The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/25/2016 1 check-in Love love loved the atmosphere! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha latte, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas? ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ", pos

I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. Seating is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors. Arrive early and be prepared to wait a bit if you with a large grop.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere! Viva matcha latte and Cortado ", pos 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart. ", pos 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/2/2016 2 check-ins Love this place!  5 stars for cleanliness 5 stars for fun ambiance/ open space 5 stars for ample seating and comfort 5 stars for convenient parking 5 stars for attentive employees and fast service  I am definitely a fan Cafe w/ a Soul. I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul , 11/10/2016 3 check-ins This place has been shown on my social media for days so i finally visited! One of THE cutest and artistic looking coffeeshops I have ever visited. You can self order which is nice because you can take your time and look at the pictures to help you decide! I especially liked how pictures were shown so I knew which coffee/tea came out aesthetically  I ordered the famous matcha green latte and i dont usually drink coffee but it went beyond my expectations. They give you a good amount and its creamy and sweet. Only downside is no wifi.. So hard to study here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 The store has A+ decoration, but honestly, the coffee it made is not as good as other coffee shop in the surrounding area. It has no wifi, so good for hang out with friend or read a book. Not sure why there is no restroom here. Ordering app is well made, but probably won't be my coffee stop because of the quality of food/coffee. It's selling you the atmosphere they created, so don't expected the food/coffee. Probably would be a good date spot. 8 dollar tiny chicken and waffle. One of the most expensive chicken and waffle. ", neutral 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee. However, it is a CUTE date place and I know that M and I will probably come back to chat, people-watch, or read books. ", neutral

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/9/2016 1 check-in Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee So, I really didn't want to write this review. I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin. Hanging out here was a wonderful experience - this is a five star establishment, the best coffee house I've been to in Austin, and I will be back - time and time again.

It's always great to see places doing something new and unique. The seating arrangements and atmosphere are definitely fun.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/15/2016 1 check-in Note: Do not come here if you're looking for a place to work remotely! There is no WiFi and no outlets. Staff says they are hoping to create an environment where people socialize and enjoy each other's company rather than being on their phones.  For a spot to catch up with friends over coffee and pastries, I highly recommend coming here! There is ample seating, an open layout, and a lot to look at  and talk about including wooden swings, books and a chess board on a table, and a cute corner of pillows in another corner.  They serve coffee drinks, waffles, and pastries. The pop tart was extremely sweet, so much so that I was unable to finish even half. Their cortado was pretty good. The food and drinks are quite pricey here, which makes me question returning.  Presentation and ambience wise, I give this place 5 stars! But price and food, probably a 3. ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot! ", pos 
The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/10/2016 This place is so cute. New favorite coffee spot on Burnet/in Northcross. Almost wish I was still in grad school,  so I would have an excuse to be there everyday.  Amazing coffee and best chicken & waffles ever! The chicken was seasoned perfectly and made for a delicious savory brunch (with the house made slaw they give you on the side). The olive oil cake was also awesome, light and sweet. Perfect coffee companion. My husband and I will definitely be back, as we loved everything and felt it was all very reasonable priced. Olive oil cake, chicken & waffle and 15-minutes-of-fame coffee!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 Tried this new cafe spot on Burnet with a friend - unassuming storefront, the decor is quaint af and you have to order from iPads at the counter and then choose a place to sit.

The cold brew coffee was fantastic and my friend's milk tea turned out great too.  Good spot for conversations. Only knocking down a star for the limited options.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/23/2016 1 check-in My best friend and I came to The Factory after seeing it on a couple of best new Austin brunch lists. It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side. I enjoyed my meal still, but it's hard to mess up Nutella and fruit, so I wasn't particularly impressed.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/7/2016 1 check-in Came in on the first day of opening, hours currently 6am-2pm. At some point they'll stay open till 12 midnight. I think this might be the most beautiful cafe in Austin, the interior is charming, snazzy, cozy. There's even a pair of swings to sit on while you enjoy your coffee and play a game of chess. I ordered the Marymint Monroe, basically a mint mojito. It's been a while since I've been to Philz coffee so it's hard to compare, but I think the Marymint is a little creamier. Also had the banana nutella waffle, bananas and nutella are always a winning combination, can't go wrong there. No wifi yet but I'm sure it will come soon.

The Marvelous Vintage Tea Party Co. ," 11/19/2012 Sophie at Marvelous Vintage Tea Party Company was absolutely amazing to work with. She puts in a huge amount of time and effort into planning exactly what you want at a budget you are comfortable with. What I especially liked about this was the fact that she's willing to let customers handle certain aspects of the event if they'd like to make their budget smaller. For example, she suggested we purchase our own flowers at wholesale. She also has connections with a liquor merchant in Austin that allows you 15% off your alcohol purchases for the event--a fantastic deal! In terms of venue, a MVTPC celebration can be hosted anywhere in the Austin areas--Sophie was more than willing to drive to Round Rock to make our celebration happen.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 11/17/2016 Listed in Master List of Vivian's Eats Ehhh. Wasn't my cup of tea.  I swung by this tiny coffeeshop on a cold February evening with my significant other. We were meeting someone for an career-focused informational interview. I have to give kudos for Vintage Heart for the awesome decor - the inside actually made me feel like I was in a pioneer-era general store. Cozy, quaint, rustic. Lots of tables, we had no trouble finding a seat for three. Several individuals were sitting around on their laptops, so I assume there was also decent wifi.  I ordered a vanilla latte. The portions are huge. That was good. I couldn't really taste the vanilla. That was bad.  I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I do enjoy my lattes. This one was a disappointment. I could barely even taste the *milk* - it was overwhelmingly coffee and water. Maybe it was just one bad experience (boyfriend enjoyed his espresso, for what that's worth), but sometimes one shot is all a restaurant gets before I look elsewhere. ", neutral 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 9/24/2016 2 check-ins I've tried the hot tea, peach oolong iced tea, and spinach croissant * Hot tea: Ordered the fruity black tea on a teapot. Keeps me awake and pretty tasty. Can ask for more hot water for free. * Peach Oolong: refreshing with a hint of sweetness. Served in a mason jar. * Spinach Croissant: they can warm it up. The croissant was a good size and can be a filling meal. Bread is nice and crisp, wish there's more of the cheese and spinach fillings though.  Atmosphere * Very homey. The space seems a bit small but its never too crowded. You may want to sit near the entrance if you prefer natural lightings. * There's a tall seating area with hanging lights up front, while the other half of the space is filled with small wooden tables and chairs. They also have a sofa all the way at the back. * There's some small tables and chairs outside for extra outdoor seatings. Almost no one ever sit outside though (perhaps because they will be looking directly at a cemetery across the street? Not sure) * Temperature is perfect!!!!! No need to bring extra layers. * I cant seem to get connected to the wi-fi when I sit closer to the front area of the store, but if you sit closer to the back then the wi-fi is great. There's also plenty of electric outlets everywhere. * The place is generallt pretty quiet, a mix of people chatting and people studying or doing work. There's always a handful of UT students, but most of the crowds seems to be non-students.  * Location: Right across a cemetery. It is also next to kebabalicious. There's a small parking lot at front and back side of the store, as well as street parking around the area.  * Service: This place probably have one of the friendliest staffs in Austin. Food and drinks are also prepared quickly. ", pos

The vibe is chill and relaxed and the decor is a lovely mix of industrial and shabby chic.  I normally get lattes here and they are hot, not too sweet and delicious. The americanos are also well done with no bitterness. Very consistent quality! My favorite food nom noms used to be the doughnuts (coffee and lavender are kick ass), the blueberry scone (100% the shit) and the ham/mozz and turkey/provolone croissant which (I swear to God) weigh at least one pound each, but I think their vendor went out of business....? The croissants are heated for you and they give you SO MUCH bang for your buck. Feels like a chipotle burrito without the diarrhea. Not sure what food they offer there now since I've moved from ATX, but I feel 100% confident that they only select the best of vendors.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/4/2016 1 check-in Listed in ATX Coffee Fix Bucolic and quaint come to mind when visiting Vintage Heart. I like how there is plenty of natural light near the front.  Parking can be a hassle even during weekday work hours when most people would be working. There are some parking spots near the back but if you do snag a spot, be forewarned that it may be hard to get out if some customers end up choosing to park near the fence, taking up more space that you could use to back out.  When I made an order for a macchiato, I was glad I caught that I was ""upcharged"" before I slid my card. I am sure it was an honest mistake but it was just something I noticed. The store owner(?) quickly corrected it in the end.  Overall, the distance from where I live as well as the parking lot situation are big enough deterrents to prevent me from visiting anytime soon. Especially with the number of high-quality coffeeshops in ATX. ", neutral

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/19/2016 1 check-in Quaint coffee house, kind of feels like your friend's living room. It's dimly lit and isn't air conditioned as well as other cafes in the area so it was only semi comfortable for me to get some work done.  The coffee is good, downside is they only had a few baked goods when I went so if you're hungry you should check out the food trucks in the nearby area before/after your coffee!

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 4/18/2016 1 check-in Alright here's the low down, I'm a sucker for drinks in a mason jar.  As soon as I see Yelp pictures of this, I'm there.  I'm not sure why, I've pondered it for quite some time, maybe I need to ask a therapist.  Anyhow, that's what led me here on a Sunday afternoon.  If you are entering from 7th street the parking can be pretty tight.  I think there are only about 2 spaces on the 7th street side of the store.  There is a back alley behind the store where there are a few more spots back there.  There is also a rear entrance to the store you can go through if you park in the back.  Once inside it has the feel of being in a small house which is pretty cool.  There is a good amount of seating divided into 2 rooms with a huge bar area with stools on both sides.  Great area for working with laptops. Now on to the drinks.  We got a cold brew and a iced chai latte.  I had to get cold drinks because again, I'm here for the mason jars.  The iced chai was very refreshing.  It tasted as a chai latte should with just the right amount of spice. The cold brew was bold and had good flavor.  No lingering after taste and just what I needed to energize me for the rest of the day. There are so many awesome coffee shops opening up all around town.  I would definitely add this one to my list of ones to try if you haven't been here.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 5/3/2016 I was looking for a not too busy, not too loud coffee shop recently that would be convenient to two of us coming from downtown and one coming from Northeast Austin. Harder to find than you would think... A friend mentioned she thought Vintage Heart was not too loud and I might like it.  Done!  Made that appointment and showed up early to scope the place out. There were a few people scattered here and there at 1pm midweek, but it really made me happy that the music was not obtrusive and I could find a place to park.  The counter staff were very pleasant and helpful, and I put in my order for a Cinnamon Latte after perusing all of the options. (Um, did I mention they have baked goods from Russell's Bakery? - Thankfully not the carrot or Italian cream cake, because those are my diet kryptonite!)  My latte came out and was really beautifully done. I have to admit my first thought was,""I bet this is going to have that fruity after taste I often notice in high end lattes.""  Nope. It was exquisite. Dark but not burnt, no fruity tones and no bitter aftertaste. Amazing coffee flavor!  I thought it might be just mine, but my friends who ordered two other flavors of lattes had the same experience. They both said, ""This is the best latte I have had in Austin.""  Nice job, Vintage Heart! I will be back and will bring more friends.  Note: I would have happily shared this review on Facebook, but for some reason it kept picking up your sign in the women's bathroom as the image, and that is NOT something I want to post.

Bae remarked that this was ""hands down the best vanilla latte I've had."" I had a Violet Femme iced tea (lavender earl grey) that was super.  The reason it gets five stars: our barista was super friendly and accommodating. She asked us - yes asked us - if we needed the wifi password. And I nearly passed out with cuteness overload when she gave it to us (that's a secret that you'll have to stop by to experience). She also gave us a ton of places to check out for brunch and hanging; they were spot on and totally our pace and level of weirdness.  All in all, this place was cool and delicious without being pretentious. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee , 10/9/2016 The coffee shop itself is cute and clean.  The lavender latte is definitely worth trying at least once.  It's lightly sweet and distinctly floral.

My favorite drink is the iced vanilla latte with lavender. I would never think to put lavender in my drink but it's SO delightful. I highly recommend! It's a good spot to chill and relax. Also, the staff is super friendly and nice. Keep it up, baristas! :) ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 9/17/2016 I work at the food truck next door and Vintage Heart's coffee and cold brew is the fuel that keeps me running. Dark, strong, fresh coffee! Only suggestion is to upgrade AC system as it does get stuffy inside when its a full house. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 4/17/2016 3 check-ins I am a picky person when it comes to coffee. I rarely drink it due to my heightened sense of taste and smell. The burnt beans and acidic flavor can sometimes be overwhelming at certain places. Vintage Heart Coffee is one of the very few places where I love to go and actually get myself a cup of coffee. Their lavender latte is UH-MAY-ZING. I really liked it with the almond milk, too. It has this subtle scent of lavender and toasted marshmallow. The ambience is so cute and cozy, yet very artsy and trendy! Their service is really great and the location is great if you are in central Austin. If I had the money and lived closer, I would come here every day! The building is covered in art on the outside, too. There is not much parking available but many people walk or ride their bicycles here so I have never had trouble actually finding parking. I bring my sister here every time she is in town from Dallas along with all of my close friends who are coffee lovers. I wish they would open a location up north but until then I will make my drive down to this location every time I crave the lavender latte. I'm thankful that such a delightful drink exists in Austin!! hehe ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/19/2016 We went to many places in Austin within 2 days and Vintage Heart is absolutely my favorite local coffee shop. I love the location, the decor and of course, the drinks. It was so cozy and very friendly, a suitable place to sit and talk for hours with  whoever you're with or just meet that day. I ordered the Lavender latte and although I loved it, I had to say the Vanilla latte my friend had was so much better. The outside was pretty spacey at well;  if the weather allowed I would have totally hung out at the porch. The colored wall is a nice touch, we took a few pictures using it as a background.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 2/25/2015 26 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials The Location: Looks like your average Austin hipster coffee joint- next to a couple food trucks, graffiti art, small lot in the back for parking. Might seem like an awkward spot to find at first. As for the inside, I love the atmosphere - chic, modern and comfortable with plenty of seating and sophisticated decor.  The Drinks: So far, I have tried the vanilla latte, cortado, and lavender latte. Everything I've had is honestly very good; I haven't tried anything here that I didn't like. Mocha soy latte was good but vanilla was better, and iced soy latte was really light and refreshing. Their hot lattes are light, smooth, and not too sweet. I highly recommend the lavender latte. Once you get it, nothing else will compare, anywhere.  The Service: Generally slow; when I go, there is usually one person working for a long line, but they are very friendly and efficient and definitely know what they're doing. Worth any wait!  Overall: Definitely my new favorite coffee shop in Austin. Great atmosphere, great coffee. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 2/25/2015 2 check-ins Listed in comfy, cozy, & chill This is one of my favorite, favorite study spots in Austin. I'm super particular about study environments, and very few would garner a 4-5 star rating from me.  Vintage Heart is warm and comfortable, with bright, natural lighting and fairy lights. It's not open very late (and probably not too brightly-lit in the evenings anyway), so it's definitely a perfect place to go for those early morning and afternoon study grinds or catch-ups. Although the venue itself is relatively small, Vintage Heart has living-room style couches, a bar, plenty of small and medium-sized tables, and a larger high table with lots of working space. Since it's slightly further from campus, it's also typically not TOO busy! Good, calm music, too, and the perfect amount of background noise. Wifi is also free and reliable!  The lavender latte tastes amazing and is super aromatic, and the vanilla mocha is chocolatey and delicious. The heart design on the foam is a nice touch.  One of my favorite things about Vintage Heart, too, is their attention to the environment and unnecessary waste - they use glass cups and mason jars for both their hot and cold drinks and use pieces of washable, patterned cloth as their napkins. Love it.  The downsides: parking is super difficult with such few lots - it could fit about seven cars in total. Also, during the peak times in the afternoon, snagging a comfortable study spot can sometimes be difficult and since there is normally only one employee making the drinks, there may be a little bit of wait. lavender latte ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 8/22/2015 4 check-ins Vintage heart took my heart for three reasons 1. The place is stunning inside. Think modern with a vintage feel that is nice and bright. 2. Available parking: While there are only maybe 6 spots in total, it's still is something and I was able to find parking quickly during my visit. 3. The staff: they go beyond expectations and make great coffee 4.Simple menu, it's not at all a overwhelming amount of choices and they have a variety of pastries to choose from!  On a rainy summer day, where the walls were leaking and people were fast to work, I had to make the hard choice between Vintage Heart and the nearby Figure 8. I was happy with my choice as  the coffee was great, I love the fact they have homemade syrups and the brownie was killer. Regardless of the atmosphere, it's a bit too quiet and small for a gathering of friends but i will surely be back! ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 2/19/2015 45 check-ins Hands down one of my favorite coffee shops in Austin. It's a small place, but I normally come in the mornings and it isn't that crowded. I love the ambience in this place. It's very conducive to studying and the baristas are so nice.  I would highly recommend the lavender latte or vanilla latte. You will NOT be disappointed! The cortado is also really good!  The only downside is that parking can be tricky here. There's a very small parking lot. I believe there are three spots in the front and a few more in the back. Just try to come when it's not busy and you should be fine. Vanilla latte. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 8/25/2015 6 check-ins Vintage Heart is one of my staple places to go. It's never packed but often has a lively energy with people chatting, working, or reading.  The baristas are kind and welcoming. They serve their coffee in cute glassware. And they are one of the only coffee shops in Austin that saves on wasting napkins by providing pretty cloth handkerchiefs for your use.  Live on the east side? Want some good coffee and a peaceful spot to meet a friend? Come and give Vintage Heart a sip. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/27/2016 The first day I tried this place out I went up to order some tea, Barrista was not rude, but not really friendly (close to unfriendly actually). Plops a teabag in a cup of hot water and shoves it over. My eyes narrow to slits, because wtf ... (usually there'll be a pot of brewed tea for you or they'll actually take the time to let the tea sit before bringing it to you), but I kiss my teeth, leave a decent tip then go back to have my ""tea"" (had to actually go back to get milk separately ... which is another irritation)  I go back to order the same thing a few hours later (was at the shop all afternoon). And this time, post-tip, I get quicker service, a pot of brewed tea, a mug with brewed tea poured in, and a special milk container with freshly poured milk ... nary a teabag in sight.  Side. Eye.  So yeah ... I liked this place and will be going back but that whole chain of events kinda got on my nerves. Maybe its because ... you know ... I'm black, and she thought I wouldn't tip (it happens), or maybe she was just having a bad morning, either way ... poor form.  I'm sure they can do better though, it is a nice Austin coffeeshop and I'm very pro-Austin-coffeshop so go support this place, because its actually a pretty cute, well laid out, clean with fast wifi (sideye @ Patika ... grrr), parking can be a bit of an issue though.  Enjoy.  PS: Will amend to 4 stars when I've gone back a couple of times to make sure poor/erratic service isn't a recurring theme here.  PS2: went back ... service was great. I like.  PS3: The wifi here is amazing ... I hang out at coffeeshops all day ... trust me on this. ", pos 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/10/2015 I wanted to go to Vintage Heart because they brew Third Coast coffee, which is my favorite in town. I was not at all disappointed.  Beautiful, modern farmhouse decor -- white walls mixed with wooden furniture. Between couches, tables, and bar stools, there are a variety of seating arrangements. There were only a few people at 10 am, which gave a nice quiet ambiance.  Barista was friendly and welcoming. The cortado she served me was amazing, and I enjoyed a donut from Red Rabbit Cooperative.  There are many places to get coffee on the East side, but this should really be your first choice.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 12/10/2015 5 check-ins This place is so cute!  Given that this is finals season for UT students, I expected to have issues finding a seat or parking, but I really didn't, which was a nice surprise. Given, I did come Thursday around noon. But never once was the place packed during my time here--in fact, it was pretty empty, which was also a surprise given that it's a pretty small space. This was only my second visit here because normally when I try to come on the weekends, it seems to be super packed.  There's a lot of natural light, and the color scheme is easy on the eyes, and the decor is super cute! I also don't get the pretentious Austin hipster vibe. Another plus is that the aesthetic of Vintage Heart is insta-worthy! haha  The environment is very conducive to studying--a variety of seating arrangements from a bar area to couches to normal chairs and tables, the wifi is free and fast (and has an adorable password!), outlets are abundant (though awkwardly placed in some spots), the music is good and soft enough so it doesn't distract. It seems like there's a mixture of people who come--middle aged people getting some work done, yuppies perusing through a newspaper/magazine, college students studying, etc. Everyone seems to be very friendly and focused on their tasks. The whole environment is pretty chill but for some reason, everyone seems to be getting in the zone pretty easily. But then again, maybe I just came at a good time.  A cute sidenote: they don't have typical napkins. They have cute, printed cloths! It's the little details about this place that make me so happy.  In terms of the beverages, the first time I came, I got a hot vanilla latte, and this time I got an iced vanilla latte. I also tried my friend's iced americano, too. All of the beverages were pretty spot on. The lattes didn't have notes of a super dark, rich espresso, which I'm personally ok with. Slightly too sweet, but I prefer my coffee on the bitter side. Prices are on par with other places in Austin.  The baristas are also very friendly, patient and seem like normal humans.  Overall, this is one of my favorite coffee spots in Austin! I personally love the vibe and the beverages. The only cons are the small-ish parking lot and the slightly dirty bathroom, but the decor of it is cute for what they had to work with haha.  10/10 would come again. and again. and again. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 3/20/2016 Was visiting Austin for SXSW and luckily discovered this place. I've never felt more welcome and comfortable away from home. The music isn't too loud and isn't the top 40 hit garbage often heard in coffee shops. (Alabama Shakes was playing during my last visit.) The customer service exceeded my expectations which is rare. These aren't the average millennial baristas who seem to hate themselves and their jobs. These baristas seem genuinely happy and devoted to making sure you get what you need. Places like this are bittersweet because it makes me painfully aware that there aren't any coffee shops as good as this one where I'm from.  Oh, and the wifi is fast, too! About 6 megs down if you're the only one using it. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 5/24/2015 Hmm, I'm kind of split on 3 or 4 stars here. Why 3 stars: the coffee was just okay. I went with yelp recommendations and ordered the iced vanilla latte. Super cute in the mason jar, but honestly kinda just tasted like Starbucks? Not necessarily a bad thing, but considering they make the vanilla syrup in house here it's just kinda disappointing. Makes me feel like I shoulda gotten espresso. Will update this review if I return!  Why 4 stars: this spot is really cute, with warm lighting and lots of seating. It's a great place to get work done (they have outlets!) or just meet up with friends.  Cool street art outside also. ", pos

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 7/26/2015 1 check-in Vintage Heart is a tiny no frills coffee shop located in a converted home.  Their roasted beans are from local Austin Third Coast Coffee Traders.  They really don't have much except coffee, as they only had a couple of pastry items on the counter.  What was nice is that out of the few items offered they did have a couple of Russell's gluten free cookies, and a muffin.  My group of friends each chose something different: a latte, a chai tee latte, and an iced coffee.  The latte art on my friends drink was beautiful.  She mentioned that her coffee was as good as her favorite spot in Brooklyn, my friend liked her Chai, and I absolutely loved my iced coffee served in a cute mason jar.  Their was only one barista working behind the counter, and she was very friendly.  The space is small and it was jam packed with warm bodies all hanging out with their laptops taking advantage of the wifi and multitude of available outlets to plug in at.  They have some tiny fans blowing limited air around, but the place definitely on this 95+ day got stuffy and warm.  We were all melting.  So while the coffee is delightful, this is not a place to hang on a hot day. feels just like home simple no frills coffee spot lots of outlets for computer peeps See all photos from Mindy H. for Vintage Heart Coffee ", neutral 
Vintage Heart Coffee ," 4/2/2014 1 check-in Listed in Austin Coffeshop Bucket List I wasn't really sure what to expect here from this interestingly located coffee shop. I had heard a lot of great things and with the up and coming EastSide, I figured it was worth checking out when I had some time to kill before pub quiz @ Gourmands.  I wasn't initially impressed when I walked into the almost barren interior with but a couple of choices on the menu. But, to my happy surprise they make a killer American for $2.75 (I LOVE that all the prices already include tax) and I also luv that they have Truvia sweetener (which is amaZingly hard to find these days).  I planted myself on the very comfy couch (I usually don't sit on coffeehouse couches being the germaphobe that I am, but this one just had that squishy look to it which made me think it would suck me in, which I luv...and I was right!) and got some work done w/the pretty quick wifi (I had a couple of recent experiences where the wifi at the cafes was incredibly slow!).  I also liked that they don't have disposable napkins or stirrers. My only complaint was the gal behind the counter was a bit cold and standoffish, but that seemed to be her demeanor in general. I wasn't expecting a hug and a cuddle-party when I walked in, but smile and some suggestions would have been nice.  I don't know that I would go out of my way, but I would probably come here again if I was in the area and needed a caffeine fix! Exterior View from the couch ", neutral

I came in on a Sunday morning and was one of only a couple people there. Good coffee for a decent price and some baked goods if you want. I came here after a bike ride and stumbled upon this shop on the East side. The décor is great and just feels like somewhere you'd want to hang out at.

You suddenly are inside of this well kept modern scenic coffee shop! Really the decor is partially why I love this place.

Vintage Heart Coffee ," 1/22/2015 I'm a sucker for cute little coffee shops and Austin definitely has a wide variety of them. Vintage Heart has to be one of my favorites!  First, the iced coffee is served in cute little mason jars. The iced vanilla latte is my preferred drink, and it's the perfect combo of sweet and creamy. Even on chillier days, I love to drink it. The interior is comfy and cozy, with a mixture of small tables, couches, and bar seating. I especially love the light fixtures!  The service is super friendly and the inside/bathrooms are clean, too!  The only downside I would have to add is that parking can be difficult (but when is it not in Austin...) and there aren't a ton of places to sit and study, especially if it's a busy day. There are a couple of tables outside, though, if you don't mind sitting outside. Either way, I love coming here to drink some good coffee and escape the school scene for a bit.

For the first time in my life, I would actually buy a larger serving of coffee if they sell it! I had the Latte and my girlfriend had the Mocha, and both were equally good. The location seems very homely, and unlike other famous/commercialized/both cafes, this place has a very welcoming feel to it. I was never a fan of Starbucks, which in my opinion, is not even worth being labeled coffee, and after going here, I hate Starbucks even more.

I usually get their full French press and share it with someone else, but all of their coffee options are delicious.

Fleet Coffee ," 11/17/2016 4 check-ins Listed in Caffeine Boost I hella love this place.  Patrick and Lorenzo are great. You can tell that they love coffee because of the great selection of beans and innovative drinks - they recently won Austin Chronicle's 'Coffee Innovation' award! They are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly too. I feel like each time I come, I'm picking their brains about brewing coffee at home. One time, Patrick gave me some grounds to compare for home and pellets to clean out my coffee grinder. Friendly, passionate, and knowledgable folks.  The drinks taste great, and the morning ritual is a nice 'treatyoself.'  I get excited each time I come to Fleet! Look forward to coming back again and again. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 11/16/2016 1 check-in I liked this coffee shop a lot! It is a small place, but very comfortable. The barista is a excellent coffee maker and any kind of coffee you choose will be delicious. I prefer Latte without sugar and to follow a simple croissant. And so begins my day.  The place is close ACC Eastview, so you can visit after or before the class with friends. A Latte and a croissant ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 9/12/2016 4.5. The owners of Fleet Coffee are some of the best Baristas in town and their coffee shop is representative of their attention to detail and artistic abilities.  I'm always fascinated with the accentuated taste of a latte or Capuccino when there is artwork! Granted it is harder to take the first sip, because you won't want to mess up the latte art.  Fleet uses extremely high quality coffee beans to make their concoctions. Speaking of concoctions, they have several creations with ingredients you wouldn't typically think of combining.  They all mix well together and you'll start to stray from your usual cup of joe.  Grab a Saturday Morning Ritual infused with fruity pebble milk! They'll even put a homemade fruity pebble treat on the plate. They make them in-house (I've seen these bad boys coming out of the oven and being cut up for serving).  If you like your espresso with a bit of a citrus kick, indulge in the E.T.  It's brilliant.  If you just want a Capuccino, that's fine too. They're exquisite.  Check out their beautifully designed and built patio furnished with wood-crafted tables and chairs.  They have wifi too, if you need a spot to connect.  You'll love this place like I do. I hope. E.T.

Fleet Coffee ," 9/25/2016 1 check-in This adorbs coffee spot was a nice change than going to my usual. They had unique options in addition to the usual coffee and latte most places have. They serve cocktail style beverages that are really fun (served with coffee, no alcohol). Don't let the location scare you. It's up and coming, although at one point I had the ""where AM I?"" moment. My only complaint was that the place was rather small without much seating. After ten minutes of sitting inside I was feeling claustrophobic as the customers came in waves so I Ieft. Overall, cute spot. I'll be back! Saturday Morning Ritual mocktail. It was So good! coffee menu ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 6/1/2016 Fleet is great and definitely worth a stop (in addition to return visits). They take their coffee and tea seriously and you can tell. They churn out some tasty stuff with a unique spin here and there. For example, you really can taste the doughnut in their doughnut infused milk.  They have ample seating outside with narrow seating inside; if you've been here, you know what I mean. It works well. I hung out here for a while sipping my espresso and having some good conversation.  Patrick and Lorenzo are great themselves and have a really good thing going that I think many will appreciate. I look forward to return visits. Morning Ritual ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 9/8/2016 My new favorite coffee shop in Austin! (And that's saying something)  The interior is a bit small, and there's not a lot of seating, but it's cozy if you can find a seat. However, they have a larger outdoor patio, so when the weather is nicer, that'll be my go-to spot. I had the opportunity to chat with the owner, Patrick, and he's super nice and funny - it's nice to have a barista who chats with you and isn't stuck up! Their coffee is great and it comes in these bright blue cups that is aesthetically pleasing to me (#instaworthy). I will definitely come back to get a quick study sesh or to catch up with friends!

Fleet Coffee ," 5/10/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" If you think it's tough following Austin's new restaurants, try keeping up with the coffee places. Fleet and Flitch are the newest local players, I think they're both great, and I'll meet you at either one. In fact, tell me which one you like, and I'll tell you what you are. Okay, I borrowed that line from a Starbucks in France.  I could tell you what beans they're using, but really, do you care? Trust Lorenzo's judgment. I benchmark places by their batch of straight black, but Fleet stops doing that around 3pm. I did think my $3.75 Madcap Spring Fling pour-over was some pretty good stuff. I know nothing about steamed milk or flavored concoctions.  I left here thinking what a clever use of interior design, it's easy to park, and this area of Webberville street sure is pretty interesting - hey, isn't that Gourmands & the new Dog & Duck Pub? Fleet takes their coffee seriously, you'll feel welcomed here, and there's Topo Chico & WiFi. Total fanville for me. 8 people can sit inside, it's a pretty clever design. Lots of outside space. That's my cup, btw. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 11/30/2016 Coffee is excellent but very fully priced. Inside is tiny and seating is pretty uncomfortable. The interior is beautifully detailed and nice to look at. HOWEVER, every time I sit down inside to drink my coffee, I leave smelling like a stale ashtray. I think this is because the place is tiny and cigarette stink blows in the door from their front porch. Bottom line, I will grab a cup to go but not hang out for an extended period of time. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 4/13/2016 Wonderful coffee shop! I went several weeks ago with a friend and all our kids. It was fairly straightforward to find, with parking in front. There are several picnic tables outside, which is always nice to find on a sunny, spring day in Austin! There is also lots of space outside that has the potential for either more tables or other things.  Inside, the shop is immaculately clean and simple. They designed the indoor space well considering the building itself is in a bit of a V shape. I know the shop is owned by two guys, one of whom I'm not familiar with, but Patrick I remember from Caffe Medici. I'm happy for the launch of his business, since I remember him being an exceptionally good barista at Medici.  They have a very creative menu. I wish I could remember off the top of my head some of the unique items they had, but on the day we came in we just kept it simple. I had a cafe au lait  with almond milk, which was excellent.  Service was great and very welcoming. Even the bathroom was clean, which is always appreciated when you go places with kids.  Hours are also easy to remember - 7 AM to 7 PM!  Definitely check out this place! Menu ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 3/31/2016 1 check-in I love this place. I'm a bit of a coffee aficionado and I know a good coffee shop when I visit one; this is the real deal. Just recently opened and running like a dream. The two owners are the sole baristas at this joint, and that seems to work because they are seemingly good friends (to customers and each other). Funnily enough, in talking to one of the baristas, we found that we had a few common friends from the KCMO coffee scene!! The coffee world is small[ish].  The indoor space at Fleet is tight, but I think it works to encourage people to spend some time outdoors or get friendly with their neighbors. The inside is a smallish trapezoid with a low bench online wall and a high bar at another (along the window). Outside, they have several picnic tables and who doesn't love some good ol' vitamin D?  They have the essential coffee items that one expects, but they also have some interesting drinks they've conjured up for the adventurous coffee drinker. A donut-infused milk drink, a root beer coffee beverage, and a delightfully crisp drink which I this is best described as a coffee version of a gin&tonic (obviously, minus the tonic). I tried the latter one on my second visit there, and it was AWESOME.  First time I visited, I asked for an iced pour over, and they said they could do that, but their iced coffee was actually brewed as a pour over and was ready à l'instant...so yeah, I went with that. It was some of the best iced coffee I've ever had.  I anticipate being rather regular at this coffee shop. Cheers!! I forget what this is called ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 5/19/2016 2 check-ins Though slightly hidden in East Austin, Fleet has a quaint but inviting exterior. Inside; however, is quite cramped. I think I would prefer to sit at one of the outdoor benches rather than try to squeeze myself in a spot inside. (Although, I hear they are expanding?)  As for the coffee - I ordered a plain latte, which was good, but didn't blow me away. I hear the ""Morning Ritual"" is a must-try, but I'm not a fan of donuts so I probably wouldn't order it!  The barista was very friendly - asked me what song requests I had, and had good music taste which was nice! Nonetheless, this definitely is not the place to sit and get work done over a cup of coffee. I think I would always grab it to go. outside Latte ", pos

Coffee is decent, drink menu is unique, iced americano (my go-to drink at new coffee shops) was really great.  THE LIDS ARE AWFUL. Half my coffee dripped away after leaking from the lid. OHHHH it made me so angry. Ridiculous gripe I know but these lids were almost as bad as the biodegradable ones that are put on cups with hot coffee...  I'll be back for their iced americanos...I'll bring my own cup next time. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in My husband, my in-laws and I stumbled upon Fleet by accident last weekend; we were chasing a food truck that was unfortunately closed. Thankfully, we found this lovely little coffee shop right next door and ordered some of their third wave coffee.  Fleet's coffee is fresh and tasty, on par with the coffee I'm used to drink in Montreal. I had an iced almond milk latte and my husband had a double espresso; both were excellent. Fleet deserves a perfect rating for its coffee and courteous service.  The venue is cute but unusually shaped, and unfortunately sits only a few people at a time. Some partially shaded seats are available outside, leaving you at the mercy of the hot Texan temperatures. This is definitely a downside, however it would not refrain me from visiting again.  We are happy to have found a nice coffee shop in Austin and we will visit again for sure! ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 7/6/2016 Absolutely fantastic! This is my new favorite coffee shop in Austin. The art and passion for coffee-making shines through here.  Definitely try the Morning Ritual if you're a fan of donuts. Just do it, you won't regret it. They have two options for espresso and I tried both kinds in a cortado and they were delicious. They also have three different coffee beans for pour overs. Again, I tried all three and my taste buds were in heaven. The pastries and tacos are tasty as well.    The place itself is quaint and cozy with a chill atmosphere. Inside is a bit small but they have a patio with long tables so it's nice to sip delicious coffee outside.  Service is extremely friendly. I've been served by Lorenzo and Patrick and they both are always happy to strike up a conversation. It's intriguing watching them make drinks because their coffee-making process is so technical, precise and neat looking.

Fleet Coffee ," 10/5/2016 This shop is one of my favorites in Austin and there is a ton of competition in this city! The space is beautiful. Nothing extravagant, just enough. The barista was welcoming and knowledgable about everything we inquired about, even the tea and its benefits. A lot of coffee shops I've been to tend to know a lot about their coffee, but that's where it stops. The iced tea my mom had was tasty and helped her upset stomach. Our espresso was wonderful. We also ordered two seasonal drinks that were both creative and well balanced. They weren't too crazy or overly sweet and both tasted great. I kind of wish I had one right now.

Fleet Coffee ," 4/18/2016 1 check-in This coffee shop was a little bit of a drive from me, but with the great Yelp reviews and being a coffee lover I was game for driving to give it a try.  They have parking right in front of the store and are across from Dog and Duck Pub and Revolution BBQ.  It is a very small, but cozy set up.  There are a few small tables, a bar looking out the window with bar stools, and some outdoor seating.  The owner\barista is very friendly and is happy to answer any questions you may have about the coffee.  They have some very interesting and unique coffee choices which sets this shop apart from others.   I had to go with the morning ritual because who doesn't love a donut hole with their coffee.  Couldn't resist also trying a cold offering and the flip top (root beer, chicory, and coffee) caught my attention.  Neither coffees disappointed and overall it was a great experience and worthwhile trek. If you are a coffee lover this place should definitely be bookmarked and on your short list of coffee shops to visit.  I'm pretty sure you won't leave disappointed. The only thing I would say, I probably wouldn't plan on coming in a large group unless it is a nice day to sit outside.  Definitely a great place to enjoy some 1 on 1 conversation with someone however. Inside. Morning ritual See all photos from Charles Y. for Fleet Coffee ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 4/22/2016 2 check-ins Listed in Best of the East Side, Coffee Shops for Writers Fleet makes a fabulous addition to East Austin's cafe scene. I thank the coffee gods for bringing such a great small business to my neighborhood.  The cafe offers a bunch of original coffee concoctions. I prefer the simple espresso drinks, especially the macchiato. The coffee is Goldilocks perfect: not too hot, not too cold, not too bitter. But on a hot day, the Claro is great: this is Fleet's lemony twist on an ice-coffee meets beer shandy (without the beer).  If you are hungry Fleet offers pastries and tacos for breakfast. I'm not sure if there are all-day food offerings.  The space on quiet stretch of Webberville road is small with a simple aesthetic: concrete, wood, tile, and glass. There are two large picnic tables outside if you want to spread out. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 4/15/2016 Very friendly guys running this cafe! I enjoyed my iced coffee, and The Morning Ritual (cortado infused with donuts) was on point! I really felt like I was drinking liquid donuts. They say they're looking at making drinks inspired by Momofuku Milk Bar so think something like fruity pebbles infused coffee. Yum.

Fleet Coffee ," 6/8/2016 38 check-ins This review is a long time coming, considering how often I go here -- I don't know much about coffee (not, say, as well as I should considering I'm a daily drinker), but I ran into one of the owners months and months before they opened and I was excited about his coffee pedigree and the location of the store -- right beside Lost Well, right across from Dog and Duck, a nice, much-needed convenient pre- or post-boozing coffee shop.  After months and months and months of delay, they finally opened, and I was there opening day. The place is smartly and tastefully designed inside, with an eye towards minimalist aesthetics (or aesthetic minimalism, if you prefer). The focus and passion here is coffee, and it shows.  I've been here multiple times, from morning to afternoon to early evening, and have been greeted warmly and by name by both Lorenzo and Patrick, the owners/baristas. They've guided me on a journey of coffee appreciation, and they'll recommend something new, or fix me an old standby with the same passion and dedication.  The prices are quite comparable to other coffee shops, they will make coffee to go, and they also sell bagged coffee.  I enjoy sitting at one on of the little tables inside, or at the window, reading, or working online (free wifi, yay!), or chatting with Lorenzo or Patrick if they aren't rushed or busy. I now no longer think that coffee is best served with copious amounts of half and half (I've never enjoyed black coffee until I started going to Fleet), and that coffee can have a flavor profile as every bit as complex and layered as a craft beer or bourbon.  The place is small but not cramped, not really a hang-out place, but there's only so much coffee one can consume in a sitting.  It's a warm, intimate, inviting place, and I have high hopes that they stick around, and I've recommended Fleet to friends and foes alike. Cappuccino by Lorenzo.... ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 5/5/2016 Knowledgeable baristas, a good selection of drip and espresso, and a beautiful space - Fleet Coffee is everything good in a coffee shop.

Fleet Coffee ," 5/9/2016 Newest coffee shop in Austin (as of this post) and it's a great addition to the Webberville area. Now the only major downside is it's size. This really isn't the type of place to go and hangout or try to get some work down as there are only about 3 tables and a counter area inside with something like 4 seats. There is also a table outside with about 6 seats (IIRC).  That being said, the coffee selection is superb. Also, the area itself is being developed so there are things to see and do. You can take your coffee to go and just kind of wander. I got myself an almond chai latter and did juts that. Staff was super friendly too. I would definitely return sometime for a cup. ", pos 
Fleet Coffee ," 3/27/2016 2 check-ins Fleet Coffee knows how to deliver when it comes to coffee! The small coffee shop offers a variety of coffees and tacos/pastry goods.  The shop's small size makes it more of a come and go place, where you drink coffee and catch up with friends, meet random friendly Austinites, lovers, ex-lovers (on second thought..), dogs, maybe even cats in strollers?  I ordered the Iced Latte and it was on point, and at a decent price. The Morning Ritual is something I'll have to try next time; who doesn't want a donut-infused espresso with a donut hole on the side?!

Fleet Coffee ," 4/26/2016 Normally when you think of a coffee shop what comes to mind is a spacious room with dim lighting and a pretty big focus on the interior design. However with Fleet this notion has been turned on its head; for all the right reasons.  The interior of Fleet is quite small, and while this may take away from being able to sit on some huge armchair and either pass out or space out on a laptop; it encourages the people in that space to converse with one another, or better yet the barista behind the counter.  As is a hallmark of Lorenzo's attention to detail, the staff at Fleet are incredibly passionate and knowledgeable about the product they are serving & I highly recommend getting into conversations about the quality of the beans they receive, because they'd be more than happy to tell you.  Since (as stated previously) the space is small I also recommend visiting during an off hour so you can enjoy the coffee without having to wait in a long line out the door, but no matter what, you're bound to have a great experience visiting Fleet.

Fleet Coffee ," 3/31/2016 Fleet Coffee finds itself situated on a burgeoning strip of Webberville, with modern architecture and large windows defining this new age of retail. Right next door, you could have a two-fer during your afternoon 'spro and beer combo; Dog and Duck has relocated next door to Fleet.  Some folks from Medici made their way to the deep East to begin providing quality coffee below Figure 8. I can appreciate the way they have married design and coffee here at their new shop.  The quarters are tight and small, but if you can land a spot, you could cozy up for a full work day here. Layout is not ideal for long hours, as it stands, but the coffee will keep you coming back.

Fleet Coffee ," 5/28/2016 Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I made a special trip here within weeks of its opening, not being on the way to anywhere I go, now that my primary commute is to the Eastside from Northwest Austin. In Cherrywood for the summer, so I hope to return soon, and to find that they haven't expanded their menu or space since my first trip. This scaled back edition of the minimalist coffee shop aesthetic is scaled up in intimacy and attention to detail. How could it not be, though, there's nowhere to hide?! Hah. I ordered my standard for comparison, The Americano, and it stacked up. Actually, I remember it being better than average, but can't remember why. More incentive to return soon. It seems to have become a crowd pleaser among Yelpers, mostly people making special trips like me, which leaves me wondering how many local people know about it. The size constraint does not make it ideal for setting up shop, but that is what makes Fleet exceptional, the smaller internet cafes in Austin are wall-to-wall with Macbook drones, too, whereas this one is just small enough to best serve people walking through the neighborhood, who want a quality coffee to-go.

I wrote a whole post about my experience at this coffee shop. You can read more and see a ton of my photos on my blog - zoyaandme.com. The holiday decorations at Mozart's are really pretty!See more photos from the trip here on my blog http://zoyaandme.com/. Loved the sunset on the Lake while at Mozart's.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 10/8/2016 I visited with a friend and I really liked the place!  They have a wide variety of desserts and plenty of drinks to choose from! I had a lemon bar and a chai latte - both of which were great and I can't wait to try more. Customer service was good - they were really good about making sure everyone was tended to. The lighting inside was a bit dark for my taste, so I'm not sure it's the best place to get work done at night, but the location is great and there is plenty of seating outside that overlooks a lake. I went at nighttime, but I'll definitely be back during the day to enjoy the view on a good weather day.  Overall this place was great and I can't wait to go back! ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 9/26/2016 Such an awesome place to have some coffee or baked goods. There is free wifi and both indoor and outdoor seating. The view is spectacular of lake Travis. There are fishes, ducks, and turtles on the lake.  Parking in the area is a bit limited due to having more than one restaurant there. If you don't find parking in that same lot, there is more parking  across the street.  I had the mozart's mocha special which tasted so good. I will definitely be back again.

This place has more out door seating than indoor. That's because they have a big patio that is two stories high. It looks over a beautiful lake. You can watch people riding their boats, jet skis, etc.  They had so many choices of drinks it was hard to choose! I tried their latte on tap and it was really good! who knew! ice latte on tap? The price range is just a little on the pricey side but i think its worth :)  I really enjoyed coming here with my best friend. I would definitely recommend this place for any occasion ^^ Hazelnut Latte Large ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 11/23/2016 1 check-in This is a pretty famous cafe. On the weekends, it's usually so busy that you have to park in a parking lot up the street. The cafe has a board walk type vibe and you can sit in a lovely indoor patio overlooking a nice view of the water. The coffee is strong. But I gave this place an extra star because of the combination of the view and the pastry selection. They had honest to god home made churros that were to die for! ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 6/18/2016 Stunning location and the view is astonishing! Huge patio with lots of seating, most people here take up the indoor spots for all day, lots of tourists. It can be very distractive at times, especially sometimes there are a lot of children running on the deck!  Jazz live music on the weekend is very relaxing (it's free, so tip please). Coffee is pretty good for the price, house mocha is my favorite. It is very rich and chocolate makes study a bit more enjoyable.  Pastries are okay. Sometimes the cake has the old /fridge taste. Nasty! But most of the time, cakes are pretty good.  Wifi is extremely poor here. Very hard to get things done while trying to connect to their internets over and over again. ", neutral

There are times when I come and get the best service and other times, the employees act like I'm an annoyance. The pastries are okay, but I wouldn't say it's worth the drive to come all the way out here and get them.  The thing I like about this place is coming during the winter holidays. There are lights strewed on the wall and it's cute to watch. They have a nice patio where you could bring your drinks and pastries and enjoy them outdoors with a cute little view. ", neutral 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 4/17/2016 5 check-ins Tons of drink and pastry choices. The parking is minimal but there is parking across the street. All things aside .. the best thing about this place is the ambience and the view of the water. They have yearly events around Christmas and do an amazing light show with music. It really is amazing and worth sitting out in the cold weather for a few minutes! There are usually a lot of students during the school year but you don't feel shy because there are plenty of adults there, too! hehe  I really love this place and would go here all the time if it were closer to where I live. Thankfully they are a ways out for me so I don't end up spending a fortune on their drinks and sweets.  The service isn't the best so just be patient and remember the view is awesome! :D ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/24/2016 1 check-in Mozart's was the first place I was asked to visit when I said I was moving to Austin, 6 years ago. Since then, I've been here a few times, and have always found it a bit overwhelming. The location can't be beat- on the lake, plenty of seating (outdoors particularly hellish in the summer) and sweet treats including Amy's ice cream. Coffee, free wifi, and the occasional duck on the lake. Pretty place. There's live music at times, too. If you're the type that doesn't care that it's touristy and crowded at all times, if you can tune out all the noise, and if you can find a seat indoors (for most of the year), you'll love it. You'll also love it if you're a people watcher. All kinds come and go here. Also, expect to have slightly stale cake in the evening. ", neutral 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/19/2016 1 check-in Mozart's is in a great spot on Lake Austin!  The view is amazing!  It is a bit touristy here, which is ok sometimes.  Other times it can feel a bit crowded here.  The tea is good and the hot chocolate is awesome!  It is a little expensive in my opinion, but they have options which is nice.  During the holidays they do a laser light show ... for FREE which is so nice of them.  Beware it draws a ton of people.  Even though there is a huge crowd I felt like it was organized and done well, but I probably wouldn't come back because of the crowd.  The outside deck offers lots of seating in addition to the indoor space.  Mozart's a cool spot to check out if you ask me. ", neutral 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 5/14/2016 Updated review 1 check-in I give This 4-stars because of its beautiful views of the lake and the ambiance in general.  Their coffee and tea is not anything that has blown me away. It's definitely good, but not much different than other cups of coffee and tea you can find around the area.  On the other hand, the views from the coffeehouse are unbeatable by any other coffeehouse in Austin. You can relax and just watch the sunset while you study or work. It's a great place to meet with friends (both small and big groups) because of the amount of seating available. The cafe is almost always full during peak hours, but there is good enough turnover so that you should be able to find seating fairly quickly. The outdoor seating is also perfect for those days that Austin weather cooperates.  Their deli items are good, but again, not much different than you could get at a typical cafe in Austin.  I definitely recommend coming here, though, during your visit to Austin, especially for the view. ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 10/9/2016 Great coffee with bottomless cold brew and pastries. You can watch the coffee bring ground up in the corner, then walk outside and enjoy the view on Lake Austin. Parking is a bit of a mess, but the view is well worth it. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 5/5/2016 1 check-in Come for the coffee and stay for the view. This place has amazing reviews and it deserves it. It sits on the lake and there's a couple of restaurants nearby.  They have a good amount of options for dessert. I got a tiramisu and Mexican hot chocolate. The tiramisu was too dry unfortunately. The Mexican hot chocolate tastes exactly like ""Abuelita Hot Chocolate"" which isn't a bad thing!  Lots of seating outside, inside not so much. This was a must stop in Austin. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 8/2/2016 Let's start with the fact that the view and feel of this place is just simply the best. I wish I lived in Austin just to come here every weekend and sip on coffee.  Shaded porch overlooking the lake, so peaceful, I can't imagine a better place to relax with a cup coffee. We only ordered an Iced Draft Latte and hot vanilla latte but they were both fantastic. Would definitely return!  Note, bring your pup to relax with you and enjoy the free wifi! Honestly I wouldn't want to spend a Sunday morning anywhere else! ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 6/20/2016 1 check-in I have no idea how the coffee is at Mozart's. I've always been here late in the evening, so I've just never had the coffee, or at least I don't remember it if I have. The Italian sodas are good, and the ice creams (Amy's) and desserts are quite good. Add the lakeside and the live music and the crowd, and usually it's a magical combo that's greater than the sum of it's parts.  Quintessentially Austin. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/20/2015 1 check-in I am reviewing their light show! Mozart's light show is absolutely amazing. It blows my mind every year, and it's different every year! There are some songs that are the same but they do always change it up. There is plenty of seating and they don't pressure you to buy anything while you watch the show. Mozart's light show is definitely something you must see when you're in Austin for the christmas time. Pre-light show ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 11/21/2015 1 check-in Listed in Vegetarian Food + Austin This is my kind of place. Beautiful view of a lake. Peaceful atmosphere. And a lot of outdoor seating.  Clearly other people also enjoy this place. The number of tables available here is insane, but it was still nearly impossible to find seats on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We wandered around and kept finding more floors and more taken seats. We finally found a table on the corner of the second floor that was free.  Things I noticed while wandering: The lower floors were much quieter than the top ones. Indoor seating is very limited, so probably not a good idea to chill here if it's hot or raining.  I'm not a coffee person, so I was looking at teas/smoothie/dessert options available on their menu when we arrived. Then I saw they had gelato. Then I saw they had vegan gelato. Yes! I ordered the vegan gelato which was a blended combination of different berries. It was delicious.  Parking will probably be a struggle, but they have a larger lot across the street.  I wish Houston had more coffee shops like this. If only it wasn't a concrete jungle. Vegan gelato ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 6/21/2016 This place is the very definition of Austin, or at least what I think it is. Coffee, live music, and outdoor seating by the lake...doesn't that just scream Austin?  Came with a friend on a Thursday night around dinner time and found that it was surprisingly pretty crowded. The inside is pretty nice although most of the appeal, I suppose, is in the outdoor area where they had someone singing. Additionally, their bathrooms are located outdoors if that's any indication. Nonetheless, they still have plenty of seats indoors if that's not really your scene.  The people working there were super friendly even though my friend and I asked way too many questions and took forever to pay.  Even though it was nearly 100 degrees, I ordered a hot vanilla latte and an espresso mousse cake. I thought the latte was fine, although it was a little bitter for me (someone who doesn't like coffee). The dessert I got seemed overpriced to me, especially considering how mediocre I found it to be. It was literally just a dry cake doused in espresso, kind of a weird juxtaposition if you ask me.  But I'm still giving this place 4 stars because I really just love the vibe and the coffee honestly is good enough for me. Also, their other desserts look really good so I'll have to come back and try them another time! Vanilla Latte and espresso mousse cake ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 11/13/2015 Nice place to get coffee with a view. it has a huge outdoor deck area that sits on the lake. Pet friendly.  They carry your regular coffee shop fixes. Drip coffee, espressos, blended drinks. And then there is ice cream, a huge variety of baked goods and a few food items. Had the empanadas and quiche before. Both pretty good. not anything extraordinary but perfect for something to have with my coffee for a light breakfast.  Fun light show on the deck during the holiday season.  If you are in the area, definitely stop by! Latte and quiche with a view of the lake! ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 9/11/2016 Love this place. Can't get much better than sitting on the edge of the lake sipping a delicious cappuccino and watching the ducks and turtles.  Plenty of shade and seating outside.  Service is usually very good for as busy as they get. If they forget something, they always hop right on it. That's only happened once in a couple years.  The cappuccino is a proper drink as well with full ristretto shots and a creamy foam on top.  I had the strawberry cheesecake this past weekend and it was incredible. Creamy and whipped, light, and rich flavor.  The parking is tough but across from lake Austin Blvd you can park in the extra lot. ", pos

They're coffee drinks are delicious.  Their desserts are a wonderful way to end a meal.  Even if the parking lot looks super packed, and the lines are long...there are plenty of seating available.

The location is what makes this place somewhere I keep coming back to - so much outside space there's always a sunny spot (or a shady one if you're so inclined) to sit in.  The coffee is good, not great, but definitely good - and they are always super accommodating of special requests.  Pastries are better than they look.  Mid range prices, ever charming service and good wifi mean I'll never complain about coming here for a meeting or a catch up. ", pos

If this sounds like your cup of Morning Joe, this place will rock your socks!  However, if you're actually there to taste test their coffee like some kind of San Francisco snob *cough*, then you might not be so impressed. It's pretty average affair coffee -- we tried both a latte and a mocha, both fell pretty short. Milk tasted a bit overdone and the mocha wasn't anything special, just tons of syrup that ended up making the beverage too sweet to even enjoy.  It's a nice relaxing place to study or work, but just don't come expecting mind-blowing coffee. ", neutral

I came here to get a flat white and they were a little confused about what I was asking for. This really looks like one of those mass production, touristy type of coffee places, except that they have free wifi, food, lots of (not so good) pastries, and an amazing outdoor space you can hang out in.  The inside is madness, there are usually two lines to order but you can't really tell, people don't really know what they want and spend anywhere between 5-10 minutes ordering sometimes two drinks. The drinks are ok, but the atmosphere is fun. The staff is friendly (but confused) and is eager to help in whatever you need. I enjoyed my ""flat white"" despite the coffee being quite bitter and the shot burned, because the deck is awesome.  The parking here is also dismal.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/9/2015 2 check-ins This place is great to drink a coffee and have a pie seeing a beautiful view. I've been there couple times and the atmosphere is very nice, especially because of the lake! I already tried apple pie and cannoli and of course many types of coffee. The apple pie is good but I didn't like the cannoli....just nothing special and no taste. People go there with family and groups and there are many students using tables with their computers. This month of December they have show of lights with Christmas song every end of each hour. Parking is free and is crowded but there are many spots in both sides of the street. I think almost $7 dollars for a small pie is expensive, maybe they are charging this price because there are many tourists and visitors over there. Most part of staff is friendly. They have wifi but it doesn't work because many people are trying to use it at the same time. So....I think the view worth it more than everything at this place. 4 stars because food and coffee are ok, nothing special to me and really expensive.

They have a private lot but it fills up pretty quickly and I was fortunate to get a parking spot. If I didn't, then across the street there's additional parking. When I go down the stairs there's a huge patio with people on their laptops and dogs just relaxing. When you enter there's two lines, it didn't occur to me to go to the other line which was shorter. Then again, I was thinking straight because lo and behold, there's the dessert display which is basically my kryptonite. Damn!  I was intrigued by the row of dessert cups and I tried the brownie tres leches which was so good. It went well with my iced coffee. What was even better was they had unlimited refills on iced coffee.

The coffee is pretty good, and they have a lot of food options, including breakfast tacos (some of which are vegetarian or vegan), pastries, baked goods, and desserts!  There's a lot of parking in front of the store, but there's also a big lot across the street!  It can get busy though!  Definitely a great place to sit and drink some coffee and relax!

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 4/10/2016 I really like this place! though giving 3.5 stars. Here's why:  Pros: This is located in a beautiful west side of Austin, right next to the river. Great view from its patio. They offer variety of sweets/drinks at moderately high price, but some are still affordable. It gets pretty packed on weekends with young adults/college students.This is the place for people watching in Austin.  Cons: Wifi is not reliable at all. It's ridiculously slow and cut off every 3 minutes - so this is not a place for you if you are here to do some work on your laptop. It is a nice spot for reading a book or chatting with friends though! Their shared restroom needs some work as well. When I used it today, one still had a poop(eeeeeewww!) floating and the other one had no lock at the door...it was a hard choice, but I made it through... ", neutral

I love going on Saturday nights when they have live music on the dock/patio - couple the music with amazing coffee and the breathtaking view of the lake and you've an amazing place to sit, chill, chat with friends, and/or lounge around all night long.  Coffee is also really nice - they roast their coffees in house and their selections of drip coffee blends have varied nicely every time I've gone. It's like $3 for bottomless coffee - great deal and great coffee (all of their coffees are smooth with no astringency). They also have pastries, cakes, and ice cream; though I haven't tried any of them...I just stick with the coffee.  All in all, it's a great place to relax, study, bring out of town friends/family, etc.! ", pos

When the sunsets, and you're enjoying a coffee on the deck overlooking the lake -- take a look at the couples around you who are ogling at each other and you know that some babies are definitely being made.  As I look at the sunset and sip my warm coffee I feel eyes ogling at me. Could it be? I look around me, guy at the other end of the beautiful deck? Nope.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 1/14/2016 This place is awesome during any time of the year. Christmas is my favorite time to go because we usually get a couple coffees, sit on the main deck and watch the light show. They offer a cold drink, some sort of iced macchiato that is extremely sweet tasting and delicious. Their brownies and chocolate cakes are delectable, but their version of pumpkin pie left us a little unsatisfied.  A wonderful place to hang out. Part of the decorations for their Christmas light show. ", pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 2/17/2015 1 check-in Listed in desserts & sugar I'm not a huge fan of studying at coffee shops, which is maybe the reason why I've only been to this Austin classic a couple of times. I love how it overlooks the lake and how large the space is. There are steps that lead downstairs, and you can eat, read, study, and sip your coffee on what feels like a dock overlooking the lake. It's pretty cool. It also has a super chill feel to it - even the writing scratched into the old wooden tables adds to that feel, as weird as it sounds.  I've gotten to try a lot of their dessert over the past couple of years, and they have a huge selection of them as well as dessert drinks. Absolutely loved their tiramisu cheesecake - it was the perfect blend of sweetness from the cream, tartness from the cream cheese, and bitterness from the espresso flavor. It also had a perfect blend of all ingredients and textures. Easily one of the best not-tiramisu-but-still-tiramisu desserts I've ever had. carrot cake, caramel chocolate chip cheesecake, tiramisu cheesecake ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/18/2016 3 check-ins Listed in Austin - Favorite Food Places I am really surprised that Mozart's is not having over 1000 reviews because this is THE place that people visit for a good cup of coffee, a bite of sweet dessert, and a wonderful time with your friends and family. I wish I can actually count how many times I visited here; unfortunately, I can't because it's too many. I first found Mozart's when I was in college. It has been here for ... like forever. All UT students visit here for coffee, meeting, or for a good time. It can get pretty crowded, especially during the school time. Parking can get difficult but there is a parking lot across street from it that should provide a lot more spaces. I love it's next to a lake. It's spacious with lots of tables for all groups. For their coffee, I like their latte either hot or cold will work. On a hot Austin summer day, I like the ice cold latte. All the good memories I had here say a lot about this place. It's hard to describe the atmosphere here at Mozart's because you will have to visit to see it yourself. This is the place I will visit when I come back to Austin. ", pos

Bottomless coffee and iced coffee! You can get enough coffee for $4 to fuel a Himalayan expedition.  The bad: the food is blah. At least you're not paying $$$$ for it, just $$, so what you're actually paying is a location tax. I had a slice of quiche, and I think it was bacon spinach but I can't remember because it was unremarkable.  7/10, I would come here again to impress visitors, or to study all day. Not for quiche.

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/30/2014 2 check-ins Nothing beats the combination of a beautiful outdoor scenery, hot coffee, and a slice of German chocolate cake. Mozart's has it all!  The scenery here makes it a perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date for coffee and dessert. Indoor seating provides the comfort of a climate controlled room while still offering nice views of the river with their large windows. The only disadvantage with indoor seating is finding a spot to actually sit! Outdoor seating is even better with their spacious deck and multitude of benches and tables. If you get a table near the river, you can watch the sun set as you share your moment with your date (or mom, depends on whoever you end up taking!).  During the Christmas Holiday's, they set up a spectacular music and Christmas light show on their patio. The show is several minutes long and is suitable for both kids and adults. I was very impressed the first time I saw the show and it made a very memorable Holiday experience. They play it several times a night, but I don't remember the time intervals so it is best to call to find the exact times.  Great place to hang out for coffee, scenery, desserts, and Christmas light show. This place is a must-go if you are ever visiting Austin. Plan this in your itinerary after you check out Mt. Bonnell (which is only about a ten minute drive).  Parking is not easy here since the complex is usually full, especially during weekends, nights, and holidays. Street parking is also available if the lot is full. Delicious slice of chocolate cake with a cup of coffee Dusk Sometimes the river runs low and the scenery isn't that great. It all depends on what time of the year you go! See all photos from Danny L. for Mozart's Coffee Roasters ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 1/9/2016 I've been to Mozart's several times for meetings, with friends, and by myself. The number 1 reason I go back is because of their location on the lake.  The coffee isn't special by Austin standards, no pour over, french press, or other small batch brew methods. If you want brewed coffee, the only option is their bottomless cup which is somewhere around $3 so the price is great and the quality isn't something I'd tell everyone about but it's not bad by any means.  They also have a wide dessert selection that I haven't tried, but several friends have and said they were good.  During the day they can be a little busy and crowded inside, but if the weather is nice you should consider sitting on the deck anyway. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area or want to drink coffee with a great view. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 12/20/2015 Went Friday night after a big meal downtown. The Christmas lights show was spectacular as usual. My cortado was tasty and the fruit cheesecake was fabulous also. I thought that the chocolate mousse was boring and more like a Snak-Pak than a real mouse. The tiramisu was elegant, moist and just sweet enough.    The location is fabulous, however with the cold wind blowing over the water in the winter it would be nice to have some source of heat. My family and I got quite cold. ", pos

But my sweet tooth won out. I ordered the raspberry and orange with a bottomless coffee. I really like that they have soy and almond milk in the self serve area. The medium blend I got was really delicious, the flavors melded perfectly together, not too strong or intense. I also hd the lake austin blend and I really enjoyed it (the lighter blend). The fruit tart was amazing. I could sing its praises for hours. The tart shell is thin and coated in chocolate, the pastry cream was ABSOLUTELY to die for, it wasn't too sweet. I don't like thin crusts and I loved this one.  Today was perfect for sitting outside and just enjoying the weather/watching the water. I like Mozart's vibe, atmosphere and  coffee. ", pos 
Mozart’s Coffee Roasters , 12/14/2015 It was pretty crowded for a Sunday night. Not sure if it is always like that for the Christmas lights or if it was because the Trail of Lights was closed for the night. Needless to say they seemed pretty well prepared for the crowd and there wasn't too long of a line for hot chocolate because they had a number of places around where you could buy that and other treats. The light show was very fun to watch and reminded me of a way smaller version of the Osborne Lights at Walt Disney World. I would definitely recommend going there for some holiday cheer and delicious hot chocolate. Only thing is there weren't very many bathrooms so make sure you go before you get there! , pos

Mozart’s Coffee Roasters ," 7/19/2015 I really like this place a lot.  If I lived in Austin, I would probably treat Mozart's the same way I treated Urth Caffe in Los Angeles - a great spot serving excellent coffee and desserts on a relaxing outdoor deck which is a good place to bring friends or to get some work done.  By Austin standards, it's a bit pricey, but you're paying for the friendly service and the tables on the water, which are well worth spending another couple of bucks.  This isn't a place to grab coffee and breakfast on the way to work or to the airport, but if you need to kill a couple of hours on a nice day during the weekend, Mozart's is your place.

I've been here before, and the biggest complaint I've heard is ""it's too expensive."" Now, I don't know if it's new or I just never knew before, but they have unlimited iced tea or hot coffee for $3.50, and unlimited iced coffee for $4.75. You can even add flavors (I had 3 glorious cups of pumpkin spice today, haha)!! I don't know if their roasts are good, or if they grind well, or any of that classy stuff, but it's unlimited, man.  My biggest complaint would be WiFi, space, and electric outlets. Yes, there's already a LOT of space, and they try hard with the outlets. It's just still risky, so if you can, go early, claim a spot, and don't leave till you're done. WiFi seemed to work for some, but not me at all. I ended up hotspotting when I needed to, then just working offline the rest of the time.  It's also an interesting demographic mix, since you'll see touristy folks and older people, then a ton of college kids studying. Can get a little noisy if you're doing hardcore work.  I mean, with a lake (isn't it actually a river?) view, unlimited drinks, and a hipster and classy vibe, what more can you ask for? Coffee cake + iced coffee w/a pump of chocolate syrup ", pos

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 12/4/2016 Moon milk.  Condensed milk? evaporated milk? Sugar? honey? Half and Half? LITERAL milk from the moon? A mix of all of the above? ...probably.  No one knows whats in it, but man are the coffees with moon milk in them GOOD. Basically, Summer Moon has a milk concoction called ""Moon Milk"" that they put in their Winter Moon (iced) and Summer Moon (hot) coffee varieties. You can choose how much moon milk is in your drinks by getting a straight up FULL summer/winter moon (a little sweet for me, personally), half, or even requesting a quarter (not on the menu). My personal favorite is the half winter moon (I personally am not a fan of hot drinks - but the half summer moon is good too!)  If you're not into sweet deliciousness, you can also get more basic coffees/lattes (good beans, good flavor) and teas.  For FOODS, you can get had pies (personal fave is the goat cheese with red pepper and caramelized onion), sandwiches, baked goods, and breakfast tacos.  100% great place to hang out! 5 stars.

I keep coming back so I guess I caught feelings for summer moon.  I tried out the moon menu with the moon milk that they use and I find that the ""moon menu"" is basically a dessert in a cup. I find that a good coffee on that moon menu is the half winter moon, if you're looking for ""a pick me up"" that's not too overly sweet or bitter. And we can't forget the mocha moon!! It's like a chocolate expresso and everything you can ask for :)  This place is a bit pricey as it adds up but it's actually cheaper than Starbucks and it's way better quality ingredients!!  The 16 oz is around 3-4$ that's cheaper than Starbucks if you order a grande (16 oz) and that already ranges to $4-5 for an iced coffee with some pumps of white mocha.  100/10 way to go, Summer Moon.

They have a beautiful interior with plenty of seating for the area, fast wifi for my remote friends and friendly staff that light up the already bright space. I drive up to this location from my East Side Coffee-haven just because it's so damn impressive.  I'm not a caffeine snob, so I can't really comment on the quality of the coffee. I'd imagine the rankings would look something like this: Above McDonalds; Below the coffee Beyonce drinks. Yep, it's probably firmly nestled in between those. I will note that their house coffee (which is what I get 99% of the time) is alway freshly brewed, which is welcomed.  Overall check out their new spot up here on Burnet, it's worth the drive.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 8/31/2016 1 check-in A friend recommended the moon milk here, so I got the Winter Moon (iced latte with moon milk and espresso). I got my latte shortly after placing the order. The Winter Moon, which claims to have seven secret ingredients, has a general flavor of caramel. It was very sweet and it was thicker than your typical latte, due to the moon milk in it. Don't underestimate the drink; even a size small is quite heavy and it will probably take longer for you to finish than other lattes. This isn't the type of drink I'd have daily because of how sweet and heavy it is, but it can definitely be a treat every once in a while.

It is no mystery while this place is always hopping. I do wish they had more room for seating, as there never seems to be ample seating for everyone.

Sure, the shop specialty blend ""moon milk"" sounds a little sketchy, but once you had it in your choice of coffee, you wouldn't think twice about drinking something called ""moon milk""! While the wood-roasted coffee beans already adds a nice aroma to the coffee, ""moon milk"" adds an unique delicious taste that is perfectly sweet.  Whether you like your coffee hot or cold, in the form of latte or cappuccino, just choose a drink that has the word ""moon"" on the menu and you'll be good to go!

The moon milk is delicious but VERY sweet. It is a special blend of secret ingredients that they make themselves.  I found out that I can just ask them to reduce the level of sweetness when ordering a drink with moon milk (Very cool!).  I also love their affrogato's with Lick ice cream.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 11/16/2016 Summermoon is just wonderful. They have a huge menu of options, not to mention their specialty ""moon milk"" which they use in their drinks. It is heavenly! I've even bought some and used it when making french toast and it was delicious!! The staff is amazingly friendly, absolutely will remember your name and what your usual is, and they make the most divine coffee. This location gets slammed around 7:45 during the week, but it drops off by 9. The space itself is warm and inviting if you're looking for a place to read or work, or just visit with a friend.  My go to is a Half Moon Latte, which is 1/2 moon milk and half regular milk. It is just the right amount of sweetness for me. This morning I tried their Vanilla Chai Latte and it was so creamy!! It isn't as spicy as some chai's are, so just a heads up about that. Their Summermoon Latte is also amazing, it is made with all moon milk, but be warned it is sweet!  They also have affogato, nitrobrew, various baked good, handpies, and sell TacoDeli breakfast tacos! What more can you ask from a coffee place? Oh and they have a rewards program, after 10 visits you get a free drink. I think it only applies if you pay with a card though, but it's nice that they offer it.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 3/23/2016 19 check-ins I love this place.  Delicious coffees of all kinds. I'm particularly fond of the winter half moon, which I inhale as if I had been wandering in the dessert for months/starving to death/dieting for a year. Rich and smooth and delicious. Even if you get it with soy, it doesn't detract from the taste at all. I also really enjoyed the rich drip coffee. And all the baked goods, but especially that banana bread. Just take my money please.  I think the difference comes down to their beans. When you have well roasted beans and good baristas/technique, you really can't go wrong.  But really, staff is nice and work very hard. They never stop moving (I once watched them from the bar for pretty much an entire day...) and are excellent at what they do. The orders come out quickly and well made. I also love the decor. I love how plentiful outlets and chairs are.  Everything is great! Come here!

Seriously what's in the moon milk? I guess if we knew the secret, we wouldn't be coming back for more! This may sound weird but it almost taste buttery to me. I've been back several times and always order the same thing since it's so good and consistently good every single time.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 3/29/2016 1 check-in My buddy Eory was in the mood for some coffee after lunch at Shake Shack, and he recommended this place.  Knowing I'm quite a coffee fiend he knew I'd take the bait..    The place looks like a cool contemporary coffee spot,  which is very nice.  It sets them apart from your typical ""too cool to look contemporary cool"" coffee joints.    The staff behind the bar was very kind and gave great suggestions for what I was wanting to try.  The hooked me up with an Espresso ConPanna and an iced coffee blended with their in house sweetened milk creamer.  The espresso was dynamite!  A nice bitter sweet dragon punch to my tastebuds finished off with just enough sweetness to calm it down.  Loved it!  The iced coffee was also a great surprise. It was bold but not acidic and the sweet milk cream did an amazing job of thickening it without making it too sweet.  My buddy and I spent the next hour just chillin talkin while sippin our iced coffees.  Normally I put these away quickly but it was too good to not enjoy slowly.  The mood of the place is mellow and relaxed.  Definitely a place I'd like to visit again.    Best of all was the price!  Normally for two premium drinks like that I'd pay over $8 at most other coffee spots but here it was just over $5 and that is one hell of a bang for your buck!  Highly recommend you check it out if you're in the mood for a mellow place to enjoy premium coffee at a great price! Close up of the espresso ConPanna Ice coffee and espresso ConPanna Menu shot!

Summermoon Coffee Bar , 7/25/2016 1 check-in What is moon milk!? I will never know but I will be forever thankful for it. For some reason their summer moon/winter moon tastes a bit different from the south location. It's still good but seems a little stronger/less sweet? Not sure lol I also really like coming in the morning for some TacoDeli breakfast tacos (that is if I come before they run out).  This is definitely one of my new favorite study spots since I moved north. They have a good amount of big open tables and it seems like a lot of people come to just get work done. There are always rushes of people and groups just socializing but I still find it very easy to concentrate. There's just a magical balance of noise and music. I also really like the music they play which helps with my productivity.  The only thing I wish they did was stay open later. 8pm seems pretty early for a coffee shop but I guess I'm used to living near campus where more students need those late night coffee shops. It's unfortunate but I guess it makes me want to get work done faster. Summermoon Latte , pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/13/2016 1 check-in Stopped by this little gem right after my lunch at Chi'lantro yesterday. I am always in the mood for a little caffeine pick me up - I blame my years as a night shifter. The place is adorable with an ""exposed brick wall"" and semi resto-hardware industrial vibe. There is free wifi - probably a must for a coffee bar.  There is a menu board with all the usual latte suspects plus a few signature mixes. I had a moonbeam or something like that. I don't remember the name, but it made a delightfully refreshing mid day perk-me-up. I'd stop by again, if I were in the hood. I probably wouldn't cross town for it, but I'm lazy like that. ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/16/2016 2 check-ins It's been over an year since I heard of Summer Moon.  The hype over their moon milk was enticing, and I was truly interested.  However, the long delay of me trying it was caused by the combination of being no where close to a Summer Moon (fueled by laziness of driving through downtown), and I wasn't sure if they had lactose-free substitutes of their Moon Milk.  I was at the Chilantro next door with a large party and a couple of them headed over the Summer Moon for coffee.  I asked and they had almond and soy substitutes, and this place was definitely much closer and more easily accessible.  The opportunity was finally here!  After a 100-plus degree afternoon spent at Walnut Creek Metropolitan Park, I was drenched in sweat and needed re-hydration.  The perfect excuse!  Walking in, your nose gets hit with a strong wave of coffee aroma.  Stronger than Starbucks in my opinion.  This place really advertises for itself.  I ordered the Wintermoon with soy as well as a cup of ice water.  They hype is real!  The Wintermoon is an iced latte with moon milk and it was absolutely delicious.  It's very sweet, but since the drink isn't thick like a frapp, the flavors aren't overwhelming.  I don't like the taste of hot coffee, but I'm a huge fan of coffee flavored anything, so this drink is essentially everything I love in a cup.  If you need me, I'm here on the Summer Moon fan train.

The barista told me an extra shot with the 20 oz was free so I opted for another shot. It was tasty, but a little sweeter than I like my coffee to be. Glad I got the extra shot or else it would've been even sweeter. I think they have an option to add less moon milk to reduce the sweetness. Gotta opt for that next time!  I went with two girlfriends from work and didn't have to wait long for our coffee. Awesome!  The second visit was only two days later. (This place is really close to work!)

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 4/25/2016 Oh. Em. Gee. I think I finally found my favorite coffee shop. What is this moon milk medley that you have created?! I know it's a secret so I won't keep prying, but whatever this heavenly nectar is that you've concocted it's amazing. I saw on Yelp people rave reviewing about their summer moon latte so I had to try it. My bf and I snagged one each and I was totally blown away; it's sweet, creamy, and actually 'velvety,' if a latte could ever be compared to that of a fancy plush couch.  I could handle drinking a summer moon latte everyday, but the friendly and helpful barista said that the half moon latte is pretty popular for those that don't want so much sweetness.  The interior is cute and simple, it's going for a 'cool coffee shop' vibe but is actually cool about it. So cool in fact that every single seat was occupied but someone on their laptop... maybe some more tables are in order.  Go order a summer moon latte. ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 9/10/2016 I'm totally thrilled this place opened up.  Since I don't deal with ""mystery"" ingredients, I can't comment on their moon-milk type drinks, but they seem to be pretty popular. (My boyfriend thinks there's butterscotch in it, at least based on the hot chocolate.) Their Velvet black coffee or an almond milk latte are my usual orders, and both are excellent. In fact, given that almond milk latte is pretty much my ""test"" for a coffee shop, I think they're my #1 at the moment.  I like the decor a lot, and for me it's a convenient place to meet up with people. Parking is usually OK (I'd suggest parking more toward the LASIK-side for more spaces and less congestion). I also like that they have some gluten free food options. My favorite is the chicken pot (hand) pie.  My nits? The front door is freaking HEAVY! Also it's much too cold for my liking to actually work inside. So I usually stay outside and it's fine; there are only a few outdoor tables but I've never had a problem getting one. Sometimes if they are busy they are very slow getting orders done. It once took me 20 minutes to get my latte, but the dude realize this and delivered it to me outside! Also the hand pies are so good but they could be a bit bigger. :-) ", pos

Those who are short on time should try their Nitro coffee, which is on tap thus removing  the wait for them to make the expresso shots. The Nitro does, however, have a lot of caffeine so those who goes that route should be prepared for a caffeine rush.  In addition to coffee they also serve breakfast tacos, sandwiches, and baked goods from other local places. I am a big fan of the lemon poppy seed bread from Russell's Bakery.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 1/24/2016 2 check-ins I came and tried Summer Moon Coffee Bar because of the rave reviews.  They have quite a few coffee choices with explanations of what most are, which is nice when trying a new coffee house.  I also liked the overall feel of the coffee bar.  They have a variety of different types of seats from couches to tables for working with laptops, to a bar\counter area which is where we ended up sitting because I wanted to watch them make the coffee.  I ordered a half summer moon latte as I don't like my coffee super sweet.  I'm glad I ordered the half because even this was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but it had a smooth taste.  My main complaint is the coffee itself tasted a bit watered down to me which added to why it tasted sweet.  So while sipping my coffee I watched as they made others drinks and the one thing I think they could improve upon is the tamping process.  They seem to be doing a good job checking the coarseness of the ground coffee bean as well as checking the time it takes to brew an ounce of espresso and adjusting accordingly, but watching the baristas tamp, it didn't look like they were applying enough pressure.  Typically tamping should be done with 45-50 pounds of pressure and it didn't look like this type of pressure was being applied.  This would explain the slight watered down espresso.  If the tamp is not applied with enough pressure it leaves air which allows the water to flow through the grounds without infusing as much coffee flavor.  It also causes more of a white foam on top of the shot of espresso which was very visible as I watched the espresso come out, as well as proof that the grounds are not getting tamped with enough pressure.  They had a scale right there on the counter and it would be nice to see them use that for newer baristas to measure the tamping pressure until they are experienced enough to know how much pressure to apply without it. Overall though, I enjoyed my trip here and when in the Domain area would definitely consider stopping in again for a cup of Joe. Yes!

How does that not spell ""AWESOME"" in every sense of the word?! If I have friends in town, this is where I am going to take them.  I always get a half Wintermoon latte or a Half Summermoon. The moon milk is nectar of the gods. The stuff is sweet so if you are NOT a sweet coffee person then you may want to order it as a plain latte and add your own sugar. The full Summer/Wintermoons are too sweet for me...and I'm a *3-4 packs of sugar* in my coffee kind of girl.  It's not everyone's cup of coffee to have it be sweet, rich, creamy, with caramel undertones with a slight hint of vanilla. Some people even drink it black. If I did, I'd probably still think their coffee is the bees knees. Good lattes come from good coffee still...after all.  But it sure is damn addictive if you like it. And thankfully, only being 5 miles away, that means I'll be here way more often.  Nice, clean, and functional layout. They've got a few tables and places for seating. I love that they have a neat wood based aesthetic around the bar area. The industrial pipe shelving? I totally want to steal it.  It's not a study sort of spot in my opinion because the chairs are mostly bar height with some that are the usual lower height...but they don't look super comfy for an hours long study session.

Summermoon Coffee Bar , 7/20/2016 1 check-in I would definitely recommend the half moon latte if you're not someone who is really into sweet flavors! It includes the specialty creamer mixed with skim milk to balance out the taste. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the things on the menu! The tables and chairs are very comfortable for people who want to study or work here and they have plenty of outlets as well as seating outside. Their music is also pretty easy going and not too distracting. My first half moon latte! , pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 10/31/2016 Cute, comfy and unique spot. You HAVE to try the moon milk in whatever you get! I tried the 007 first and it was delicious. They also have pastries, bottled drinks and tacos from Taco Deli. I came and did some work on a Saturday and got a great seat. Wasn't too noisy or distracting. The employees were very helpful since it was my first time and I had some questions. Now it's my go-to since it's right by my apartment! ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 6/26/2016 My new favorite cafe. I'm a lifelong Starbucks devotee but this place is great. Starbucks might be one of the only major food chains that I'm crazy about, but when it comes to local businesses, I've got a soft spot.  I've always despised cold coffee drinks (when I DO drink coffee)...until I tried the 007 and the Wintermoon. I've been to Summer Moon about 3 times now and I'm so in love.  Try the Lavender + Honey cookie. It's a combo like no other. ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 1/5/2016 3 check-ins No more questing down south for Summermoon! Not that it isn't worth the trek. But now it's not required! The Burnet location is open and I am in trouble.  The liquid ambrosia they imbue into their lattes, called ""moon milk"", is smooth as silk and completely addicting. It's so delicious and rich that I actually enjoy the Half Moon (half sweet) variation. My husband loves their vanilla chai latte. They also offer a variety of delectable breakfast tacos, pastries, and hand pies.  Do yourself a favor and stop by for a flavorful treat! Now Open on Burnet!

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/17/2016 2 check-ins To the staff: smile every one in a while and see how it makes the customer feel, you'd be surprised by the simple jester. Other than that the coffee is as good as ever, especially with their super secret moon milk. I ordered my usual Summermoon latte and a 007, which is espresso shots with moon milk shaken, not stirred. It was yummy. This location didn't have the local SoAP products like the original location so the north location doesn't have that ""local"" feel to it - more like a impersonal franchise. I'll be back only because I don't venture to south Austin very much and because of their coffee products, but please crack a smile now and then and see how it perks up the place. ", neutral

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 7/29/2016 I'm a really big fan of summer moon and it's famous ""moon milk.""  The drinks are delicious and it's arguably my favorite coffee in Austin in terms of taste.  Try the Mocha Moon Latte Iced, the Winter Moon, or my girlfriend's favorite, the 007.  All of these drinks do the trick and give you that delicious and much needed buzz in the morning.  If you're looking for beans, this is a great place too.  My work commonly uses Summer Moon's coffee to brew in the office and it is just as good as the artisan drinks.  With all plusses come with minuses as it pertains to Summer Moon.  While the coffee is absolutely delicious, I am constantly faced with a pretty significant line from the hours of 7-10 in the Domain location.  This is a result of popularity of course, but some level of disorganization.  It certainly seems like the company could use one extra helping hand during these hours instead of having barista's constantly running back and forth to the register to take orders.  If you're coming in early, be prepared to wait a good 10-15 for your drink.  Don't come in a rush.  Thanks Summer Moon.  Despite my small constructive criticism you and your employees rock!

Summermoon Coffee Bar , 7/26/2016 I had the half moon latte and my husband had this tropical ice tea thing and both were amazing!

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 12/12/2015 So excited we have one in North Austin! Their coffee is amazing and I've missed it since I moved from South Austin 5 years ago. 1/2 moon will always be my favorite drink- iced or hot. The pastries are from Russell's, so you can't go wrong with anything there. The interior of this location is lovely. I'm sure it will be crazy packed in no time. Everyone working on opening morning was very kind and seemed excited to work there.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 9/12/2016 Wow!!!!! Amazing coffee!!!! I have recently moved to Austin, and after seeing summer moon on tv I knew I had to check it out. I was so surprised by how awesome it is. The moon milk is the best part providing a smooth sweet finish. The fire roasted beans also aid in the smooth finish and never taste burnt. The coffee shop is super cute, and their t-shirts and mugs are one of my favorite parts!! ", pos 
Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 5/26/2016 I've been here about 5 times.  Recently to work and buy beans.    When I check out a real coffee shop I always order an espresso or a macchiato. No sugar.

My cold brew is actually strong, my Tacodeli taco is as fresh as it can be, and the employees were very friendly.  Though I live closer to Epoch, this place won me over.

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 6/30/2016 Northies rejoice! This part of town has been overrun with Starbucks for too long and I've been patiently waiting for a decent coffee shop to pop up. Thank goodness Summer Moon is here. Being pregnant I don't get to have coffee much, so when I do, it better be good. (I am actually writing this review as I plot my next visit.)  While they have a lot of the standard variations of coffee and espresso, their Moon Milk is what makes them extra special. Another reviewer said it's like crack and I have to agree. I am normally a bit of a purist with my coffee, drinking it either black or with just a little cream, but not here. The Winter Moon is my favorite summer treat.  Plus the aesthetic is nice, there is always parking and the baristas are friendly and very efficient so I have never waited long.  See you again soon Summer Moon! ", pos

Summermoon Coffee Bar ," 4/9/2016 1 check-in I think I've found my new study place for when I'm in town. I think I've also found my new favorite drink for when I want to treat myself.  The staff here are super friendly - the barista was quick to recommend anything with the moon milk and tell me about how the sweetness could be adjusted. I ended up ordering a quarter mocha moon latte, which was the perfect amount of sweetness and tasted so good that I promptly burned my tongue trying to take another sip. (Admittedly I've been craving a good mocha for a looooong time, but this really was amazing!)  There's also an ample amount of seating and lots of outlets. Even on a Saturday afternoon there were plenty of seats open with lots of people studying and people popping in and out for chats. They also have a nice selection of small bites for anyone who's feeling hungry. And also, the parking is a big plus. ", pos

Pumped about their cold brew on nitro (every other cold brew I've had on nitro pales in comparison) as well as their affagatos served with local Lick ice cream, with two vegan flavors!  So glad summermoon opened in north Austin and we will be customers for years to come. ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 11/27/2016 Big fan of this place! Both the food and the coffee have been good every time I've been. Last time I was here, I ordered a basic dark roast and it was very rich in flavor. I love that they have a study area/room off to the side. I'm always able to be very productive in there because it is nice and quiet. They have comfy couches if you're just coming to read or hang out. The employees that work here are super friendly and helpful! They are accommodating of customer requests and are knowledgeable of the menu. The only issue I sometimes have with Monkey Nest  is that it can get really crowded. There have been a couple times I've had to leave because I couldn't find a spot.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 9/21/2016 2 check-ins GET THE THAI TEA NOW!  I was driving around local coffee shops but they all closed and the other cafes that opened 24/7 were way too packed. Thankfully we were able to find a spot right against the window and it was the perfect seat!  First time coming here I got the Thai Tea and my boyfriend got an iced coffee with hazel nut syrup. The coffee was very delicious and had the perfect amount of syrup. THE THAI TEA THOUGH! I've never had thai tea that tasted as good as Monkey Nest Cafe's! Even at boba shops they don't have it this good. The tea and the milk ratio is perfect and the sweetness is on point! I definitely recommend getting this drink. It does not have any caffeine in it. Also get it in large because you will regret not having the most you can. The price range here is actually very reasonable. They also sell baked good, sandwhiches, pizzas, and other retail drinks.  One thing customers may not like about this place is how packed it is. they have a bunch of tables for students and others to come and study. However, it is always packed and so you kind of have to fight for a spot.  The second time i came here I got the Sea Salt Caramel Latte. It sounded really really good but unfortunately it was just ""alright."" It tasted just like milk and ice. Either there wasn't enough espresso or too much milk.  Overall the customer service is great here. The workers are super sweet. Try not to come here to study for finals or an important test. It'll be a little hard to focus with all the people around you and noise and the delicious food smell distracting you. :) salted caramel latte. taste like milk Ice coffee Large Thai Tea Large! please get it!

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 8/8/2016 2 check-ins I always passed this place up thinking it was just another coffee bar.  Then my friend played there one Saturday evening, Kat Hale and the Candied Yams, so I drove up to see her play.  Initially I thought I'll get coffee and listen to her play and that will be that.  There is so much more there than coffee and it is all SO yummy!  By the time I got up there I had not eaten dinner, so I ordered a Crab Bisque soup along with an incredibly delicious Bacon and Spinach Quiche.  It was not one of those situations you frequently find yourself in at some random coffee bar where there is only only flavor of quiche and there is only one left from that morning.  Nope, no, sir, not here!  They had options for quiche, sandwiches, pies, empanadas, coffees, pizza, etc.  I couldn't believe it.  To me it was like a coffee bar finally woke up and said, ""People are hungry and finger food won't cut it!  They need options!""  Yes, we do need options!  More than something the size of our dang hand that does not fill us up!  Well, Monkey Nest gives you options people!  Once I got my food I discovered there is plenty of space to sit and talk, or study.  There was quite a large group of us there to watch Kat and Kyle play and we all had a great time.  In fact, quite a few of us ended up staying well over an hour after they were done playing because we enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks/food enough to stay.  I may live South side, but next time I'm North, I'll be stopping by. Kat Hale and the Candied Yams Live music ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/1/2016 2 check-ins Your standard cafe that also sells food and is good for studying or catching up with friend. If you come during peak time though, say, a Thursday night during finals week, the wifi can be extremely slow, I actually couldn't connect at all and had to use my friend's personal hotspot instead. So I probably won't come here to study.  With Starbucks drinks being the bottom line, the latte here is pretty average. That is, better than Starbucks but nothing special in comparison to the many other coffee shops in Austin.  Just your basic coffeehouse with good vibes, food that smells really good (but I have yet to try), and standard coffee drinks. Nothing more, nothing less. ", neutral 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 9/23/2016 1 check-in I loved their monkeynest sandwich and thai tea. However they usually have live music playing and the place is crowded and it can get really hard to study. Food takes a while for it to come out, but their sandwiches are really good. I love their salsa and their thai tea has a bit of fruitiness and tangy without being overly too sweet.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in I would have to say my favorite flavor of the iced coffee is the hazelnut one. It is way too tasty for my own good. I would like to drink one every day but unfortunately not from here. If I could I would. It's either Starbucks or me trying to find Austin's sense of coffee.  I think this needs to be an occasional treat for me, but if you are closer, then it should be a daily yum for you! If traffic is not so bad in Austin I would definitely come here more often. ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 3/20/2016 2 check-ins Every time I'd be cruising down Burnet Rd. I'd see this place and say to myself ""I am gonna try this place out"" but I was always in a hurry or I already had my coffee fix for the day.  But this time I woke up and deprived myself of my usual cup of morning joe and said to myself ""Nah bro..today you're gonna wait for Monkey's Nest Coffee!""  So my friend and I went down there to check it out.  As soon as we walked in you could smell the fresh ground roasted coffee in the air.  I knew i was gonna be happy already!  My go to item to test a coffee shop out is their iced coffee.  While I was deciding what to drink I couldn't help but notice just how much stuff they offer besides beverages! Lots and lots of food items and plenty of stuff pre-packed to go.  But I settled for a banana nut espresso muffin to go with the coffee.  Now they say their coffee is organic..and personally I can't say I can taste a huge difference but I did love how the coffee came out.   They give it to you plain with the flavoring of your choice.  It's up to you to sweeten and dress it how you like.  Most other places do it for you, but I like how they give me the choice to do it.  If you're lazy you won't like this at all, lol!  The atmosphere is very chill with lots of nice interior decor and the people seemed really nice.  The staff was very happy to answer my questions regarding their menu and items.  I have to come back and try some of their food items.  They look absolutely mouth watering.  But for now, I will just enjoy the coffee...  Super smooth and delicious!  Stop by if you need a coffee or snack fix. Espresso shake. When you wanna cheat treat and be hyper to burn the calories!! I know that feel, breh! I'm about that coffee life too, mang!

It was impressive to see the staff act as a well-oiled machine.  I had the Italian Panini at lunch and it was perfect. The ciabatta was not too hard, the prosciutto was salty and slightly crisp, and the mozzarella was melted perfectly. It also came with a pickle and chip and salsa.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 1/11/2016 1 check-in Listed in Places to study in ATX/HTX Monkey Nest was my second home during my thesis writing process and I honestly may not have finished my thesis without it. Their decision to go 24/7 last year totally revolutionized the Austin coffee scene, giving night owls a fourth option (in addition to Bennu, Epoch, and Buzz Mill) for places to set up base for long work nights. But Monkey Nest is much more than just an alternative to those places - it's a unique, reliable establishment with a lot to offer.  One of the qualities that sets Monkey Nest apart is their willingness to serve fresh food all night. While you may be limited to reheated pizza and stale muffins at other places, Monkey Nest will serve up fresh sandwiches and flatbread pizzas into the late hours of the night (or morning). Some sandwiches can be hit or mess, but certain options (like the Green Goddess) are especially great choices.  There's also a variety of prepared foods here that are quite nice. I was surprised (but happy) to see salads, house prepped oatmeals, and even a dolma platter available for sale. Of course, you also have your option of pastries and cakes (all of which are either made in-house or from local vendors), but having the option to get healthy snacks is a huge perk that I haven't seen in many other coffee shops.  There's a ton of seating inside, but Monkey Nest can get quite crowded during certain times of the year (think finals week for students). The wifi will drop off during the busiest times, but I've found it to be OK when I've needed it most. The parking lot is also basically endless, so it's never been a hassle to come here.  Lastly, the coffee is solid, reasonably priced, and effective. They have specialty coffee drinks that are definitely worth a try - I like the Spicy Monkey Mocha, Honey Luv Latte, and Monkey's Uncle. The Four Ton Gorilla is as advertised (four shots of espresso), so I would not recommend it if you are prone to heart attacks.  Thanks for being a part of my life, Monkey Nest! ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 12/12/2015 We were in the area and Googled ""coffee"" and found this spot. The latte flavors sounded delicious, but the 'Chocolate Chimp' and 'Nutty Irishman' left so very little to be desired. They tasted like plain lattes, and not very good plain lattes. Five bucks for a flavored latte that doesn't have a flavor...  I guess the 24/hour concept is pretty cool and convenient, probably won't be headed back any time soon. ", neutral 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 7/12/2016 1 check-in Food: Monkey nest special on ciabatta was pretty good, I like that they had a variety of breads to choose from. The cashier recommended me the spicy monkey mocha since it is popular, but I thought it was too spicy for me. The sweetness was the right amount though.    Study friendly? They do have a lot of tables available but I thought the tables were too small and being able to sprawl my stuff around is high priority. The shop was well lit and also has plenty of outlets.  For Pokemon go players: At the risk of sounding like a dork, this place isn't a pokestop even though the monkey nest mural right next to it is (it is so close to being within the vicinity it's upsetting), so sadly I could not collect pokeballs while studying :( ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 9/26/2016 5 check-ins Opening 24/7, 7 days a week, Monkey Nest has got to be one of my favorite go to study spots for those late night cram sessions! Say goodbye to your local version of the Perry Casteñanda Library and hello to good vibes, roasty toasty smells, and ambient lighting. Coffee + Thai Tea are great, but I would not recommend any of the pastries. They taste fake and boxy and old. But you'll go bananas (heh) for the sandwiches! They are pretty good! But one time I ordered a drink w a monkey in it that looked pretty on the menu and when they brought it out it looked all scribally haha! Saturday nights are sorta loud though for studying because some groovy local bands come out to play! And music choice vary! From folky tunes to grandma swingy jazz (the grandmas were so cute btw LOL)! Btw they would really appreciate it if you be a good audience and clap/snap! Overall if you're looking for that perfectomundo ""late night coffee shop"" vibe like on Spotify, MN is your place to go! Let them have cake! Hot Thai Tea: cinnamon flavor will give your tastebuds that extra kick! ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/8/2015 YAY! This place is 24/7 now? My top choice for any time studying.  This place does get loud from time to time but of the all day and night coffee shop options, this is the best and here is why, 1) location is off Burnet and super convenient. 2) parking is strightforward 3) great food, great coffee 4) plugs at most tables 5) clean comfortable decor 6) friendly staff.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/24/2015 1 check-in I give this place 3.5 stars.  Came here on Friday to study. 1) coffee comes in those huge cute coffee mugs. - cute but not cool b/c it gets cold fast. If you're there to sit and study and marinate in knowledge.. better to ask for a to-go cup 2) the place is super loud. music going. some lady in the back (there's always that one lady) who can't conversate with an inside voice 3) monkey bread was delicious 4) stayed there so long we ordered lunch!!!  LUNCH: had the chicken salad sandwich - yum! menu says it is served warm, its not. b/c that's gross. obviously. lol. had it on the GF bun, it was better than expected with exception of one huge glaring detail. WE both ordered our meals with no onions. It had them on there anyway, long curvy strips, some chopped small bits. If I was allergic this would be a huge airway issue. but luckily I only just detest them with every fiber of my soul and picked them out  Unfortunately I had the RED ONION taste in my mouth now. ew.  Overall, I love that it's open 24/7. But it gets a star deducted for the onion. and .25 for being cold and kinda loud... ", neutral

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 5/15/2016 3 check-ins This is an amazing coffee place! When you pull up to the place it has a nice curb appeal. There is some monkey art is the parking area. We stopped here in the afternoon and surprisingly it was packed! There was a sign on the front door that said something about music not being played during finals week, so we guessed it was finals week. The store had many seating options, but few were available. Everyone seated by us were very quiet and I felt weird speaking in a low voice, so this seems to be a great study location. I am not a huge coffee person because it is never perfect, either too sweet or too much coffee aftertaste. I ordered a chocolate chimp and the first thing that caught my eye was the foam design. It was in the shape of a chimp. I didn't even know that was possible, perfect presentation. The taste was amazing as well, not too sweet and no bad coffee aftertaste. This is the greatest coffee I have ever had. Wish I lived closer, I would definitely be an avid coffee drinker. Monkeys uncle Chocolate chimp! ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 12/1/2015 My Nutty Irishman latte was ok, but it felt like the hazelnut and irish cream canceled each other out.  It was good, but didn't rock my world like the Espresso Shake did!  The Espresso Shake was absolutely amazing.  Its the best frozen coffee drink I've ever tasted, and among the top milkshakes I've ever enjoyed.  I will come back just to have this!  Very strong and rich, perfect consistency, perfect temperature, not too sweet or syrupy.  If you know anyone who loves coffee ice cream, you need to bring them here to try this! ", pos

Tons of little tables and chairs (perfect for working or socializing), some couches (perfect for relaxing/chilling/reading), nice warm decor. The people working here are also amazingly friendly! They also have live music oftentimes, which is pretty neat. Definitely a great place to get some work done or meeting with friends. And they're open 24/7! ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 5/28/2015 Updated review 1 check-in Welp, it's been 2 days and we've ordered 7 drinks. Lattes of varying flavors (lavender, irish cream, hazelnut+irish cream, 2 spiced brown sugars, and almond+coconut) and it seems like they taste pretty similar with the exception of lavender. However, ALL were delicious and I appreciate a good latte. Spiced brown sugar is an excellent choice :) We also got iced tropical green tea with lemonade - it tastes nothing like starbucks, but was very refreshing and enjoyable!  We also got food today and were VERY happy. We ordered the chicken mozzarella basil pesto pizza, and the grilled cheese with chips and salsa. The grilled cheese was $4.99 with feta and mozzarella and was incredible. It's hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but it's always nice to get one exceptionally good. The pizza was very filling and the chicken tasted fresh. We shared both and were not hungry at all after.  We were helped by a different round of baristas from yesterday (where are you, Josh?) but they were just as nice and helpful. They checked to make sure our large order was correct, which I appreciated. Food came out fast, and I can't imagine why people would complain about the wait time. I'd rather wait a few minutes for them to cook my food than unwrap something to stick in a sandwich press.  Overall, Monkey Nest makes me wish I was staying in Austin this summer. Great place.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 3/2/2016 It's 24 hours, so it's that. Coffee is money. There's so many to choose from, I just chose the spicy monkey and the irish one. They're winners. Wheatgrass is more expensive than Juiceland; that's what I don't understand. I guess you're studying and desperate, a couple dollars don't matter. This is Austin. Be wild and free and hang out with Monkeys. I'll stop by when I have some work to do and my own insomni-maniacal secret study spot just ain't good enough. ", neutral

We also wanted tea. Luckily, Monkey Nest has both! We snagged some red velvet cake and a couple of teas. Everything was great and reasonably priced. Service was friendly. This is one of those places that I thought could have suffered from bad hipster service. Not the case here. I just wish there were more parking spots and more places to sit. ", pos

Good coffee + yummy pastries + plenty of seating = the perfect coffee shop  I've visited their location on 24th a few times but this was my first visit to their original location and wow! I can't believe I've never visited this place before. Parking is pretty convenient since they have their own lot. There are plenty of seats inside, with a good amount of outlets so you can find a lot of people working/studying here.  I always order the Iced Salted Caramel Latte when I visit. They have their drinks in 2 sizes (16 & 24oz.). I also tried their Monkey Muffin which was delicious! It had pecans, brown sugar, and cinnamon. My friend ordered a Chocolate Chip Latte & a Blueberry Muffin which I really liked as well! The staff were pretty friendly when I had questions about the pastries.  I would definitely re-visit to try their breakfast tacos and their other pastries. We stayed until almost 7 PM on a Monday and a band started playing so you can definitely come here to enjoy a little music as well for a perfect date night.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 11/24/2015 1 check-in So, I set eyes on this location a while ago in addition to all the great reviews, I made it a point to bookmark it. Having idle time the other day, stopped in and ordered a Cafe Latte and one of the Apple Turnovers.  I was very disappointed in the coffee. It taste burned and far too acidic. The presentation was fantastic but the quality was on the low end. Its been a tough road comparing coffee in the states, as much of it seems to be a ""fad"" as opposed to good coffee. Although my visit to Red Horn Coffee House was a great experience. I guess if I'm ordering a flavored coffee from Monkey Nest, it might mask the low quality coffee enough to enjoy. The apple turnover however was really good. Plus one star....  The location was quite busy and packed with students and young adults. There is free WiFi which makes it a great location to camp for a bit.  Not sure i'll be back though...... ", neutral

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 10/20/2014 63 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" So I was thinking about doing a list of all the Starbucks in town, which means I would have to bat out a bunch of reviews on the Starbucks I haven't reviewed already, and suddenly that seemed like a lot of repetitive work. So let's talk about Monkey Nest instead.  And I'll make it quick: I'm a fan of Monkey Nest because I'm a fan of Monkey Nest. It's consistent, it's dependable, and I've always found a place to park and sit. Sometimes, that's all I need. And when I think about it, I've done coffee here with just about everyone I know in Austin, at one time or another, and that makes it a little more special to me. I can think of certain people right now, and Monkey Nest will invariably come to mind.    The straight coffee's always been okay, I know nothing about their Monkey latte or Monkey Chai, and they have a real kitchen making real food. I'm kind of fascinated with their giant bowl of boiled eggs and Monkey snacks in the counter display. Lots of cakes & stuff too. I'm pretty sure they also have live music certain nights, but don't quote me, because I'm mainly here in the daytime.  Monkey Nest is apparently doing well, they've just opened a new nest around UT, and I'm genuinely happy for their success. I know there are Monkey deals during Monkey Happy Hour, I just don't know what they are. But I do have a Monkey punch card. It occurs to me this review is a little all over the place, maybe like a bunch of monkeys, um, looking for a nest. Okay, we'll approach this philosophically: Austin is to Monkey Nest, what Life is to - oh, make up your own ending. I gonna go have a coffee moment. Yes, they have highchairs here. Handy for conversing with toddlers. If you're a regular here, they've rearranged the little fireplace/stage area. Disrupts my sense of stability... They make their own breakfast tacos here. The vegan doesn't suck. Central Market is hard to beat though. See all photos from Errol M. for Monkey Nest Coffee ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 12/3/2015 They have, by far, one of the best lattes in town. There's typically always a place to sit for studying and/or getting work done. The music is also very mellow and isn't distracting. I recommend their hazelnut latte. It's always mixed to perfection when I grab one. They have a great selection of foods here, as well. Hearty breakfast tacos and numerous breakfast pastries are the perfect start to anyone's day. ", pos 
Monkey Nest Coffee ," 3/2/2016 First time here, and I really enjoyed it. Comfortable and easy-going, like you would expect from a coffee shop. As I waited for my order, I couldn't help but to observe my surroundings. The decor and branding felt so classic-Austin (or at least the Austin/Burnet Road I fell in love with in the first place), versus some of the newer ""cool"" concepts that are just a bit too contrived.  Liked the variety of food and drink options on the menu. And though I came at regular hours, the 24-hour factor is great.  I ordered a regular cup of joe and the Green Friend smoothie with protein. Thought the smoothie was too sweet, like someone dumped Fun Dip in it, but maybe I just ordered wrong. It also took 10 minutes to get the smoothie, which seemed excessive considering I didn't have to wait in line to order and my coffee was given to me immediately.  If I lived closer, I'd probably frequent more often. ", pos

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 4/26/2016 While staying in Austin, my coffee shop of choice has been Monkey Nest, a close facsimile of Starbucks with more personality than the national chain. The apartment I'm renting is literally right behind it, so it's a sweet under one minute commute to get to ""work"". I've enjoyed many a work session here at one of their MANY tables or in one of the comfy chairs by the fireplace. There's even a back room and a quiet nook beside it where you can get away from the louder open room and the barista banter at the counter. Open 24 hours, this place has been busy no matter when I come, morning or afternoon (haven't been here at 2am yet though).

Luckily their parking extends to the back, I've never had a true problem being able to park, but I have also never been able to get a spot up front. The staff is very friendly and the drinks are delicious. I think what sets this shop apart from the rest for me is the Dolmas platter they have. Delicious and filling at under 5$, its something no other coffee shop has and I'm addicted. I usually get my coffee to-go or am able to sit outside during the cooler months. Inside is difficult to grab and even more difficult when you are with friends. All in all its a great place, but doesn't have me swinging in often. ", pos

This ideal coffee spot would need to have plenty of seating, plug points, and a friendly staff.  Monkey Nest Coffee certainly meets all of these needs.  Located on Burnett near the AMLI 5350, it's the perfect spot for us non downtown folk to grab an organic cup of joe (although I prefer the Persian iced tea) and have a tasty meal while we work.    Every time I have gone in, I've been greeted by a friendly member of the staff.  If the line is long, I know it won't be a long wait because they are super efficient here.  If I have to wait because they are all out of bacon/egg breakfast tacos (which are delicious!), they always apologize for making me wait.  ""Well worth it"", I say.  I really can't say enough good about this spot!  They even reward regular users with a punch card system; something I haven't seen around for a while.

Monkey Nest Coffee ," 1/15/2015 1 check-in This might just be the best coffee in Austin. It is certainly the coolest cafe I've ever been to. They have a full deli for fresh sandwiches served all day, a bakery that rivals places that bake for a living, live music performing weekly and artwork sold from local artists. What's not to like.  I'd highly recommend the Waka Jawaka coffee: black, iced, no sugar. This way you can understand just how good the product is without cream or sugar influencing your decision.  For pastry, please please please try the monkey muffin. It has honey, walnuts, maple syrup and God knows what else.  For the Austinite health freaks...do not fret. They have healthy breakfast options as well as gluten-free and vegan options.  And finally for sandwiches, the chicken pita wrap is all I've tried so far and as far as I'm concerned - that's all I need. It was perfect.

While waiting, I slurped down a very satisfying cold press iced coffee (toddy) and wife sipped on one of their wonderful tea options.  In fact, she was remorseful she didn't purchase any to go.  While the hip factor leans more towards the customers vs. the decor, which leans modern/eclectic-ish, it's still a top spot for all types to drink, study, work, whatever.  A fav and a fan. ", pos

It's that delicious espresso and that creamy milk that they use!  The baristas are friendly, knowledgeable, and fast.  Wifi, outlets, and tons of indoor and outdoor seating so it's a great place to get your work done.  They also have beer on tap!

Two Hands is a perfect addition to the area. They are great for a stop-in morning cup of joe, lunch coffee dates, casual beer, or late night espresso. On my Thursday night stop, they had an acoustic set which created the perfect ambience for a post Kung-Fu coffee. (and a truffle, who am I kidding)  Hopefully the barista with the strong southern accent stays around, because he called me ma'am and it was amazing.  You should definitely come here. They've designed their menu and space to maximize the potential for customers at all times during the day. Morning, afternoon or night you can find some reason to stop by Two Hands.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 4/6/2016 1 check-in Listed in Wi-Fi for Free, Hippies love it!, The Places I Go Out Coffee is in the name, and yes, Apanas (formerly ""Two Hands"") makes a fine array of fair-trade, sustainably grown/harvested caffeine-infused beverages, but I'm impressed with much more about this new spot in my part of town:  Beer. Delicious beer by (mostly) Texas craft brewers. On tap and by the bottle in a rotating selection of brands like South Austin, Founders, Real Ale, Adelbert's, Stone, Breckenridge, Deep Ellum, Odell, Left Hand. Served by a friendly, handsome, Southern gentleman who called me ""Ma'am"" in an alluring way that made me want to order another round. When I expressed curiosity about one of the selections, he immediately produced a sample glass. Swoon.  Wine, for my proper lady friends who don't want to drink delicious beer. There were a few decent choices in red and white, plus a prosecco for my bubbly-lovers.  Price point, not bad at all for the hoity-toity Domain. Coffee drinks range from $2.30 - $3.50, fresh juice blends are $7, beers range from $4-$7. Happy hour from 4-7p with $1 off drafts & wines by the glass :-)  Serving assorted convenience foods from local stars: pastries (by Quack's), breakfast tacos (by Tyson), and sandwiches & salads (by Fricano's).  Bright, modern decor, with tons of natural lighting and plenty of seating for dining, sipping, or even working. There are lots of electrical outlets and I spied quite a few laptops in service during my recent evening visit.  I love that I was able to come in here fresh off a run, a little sweaty & still in my active wear, yet I was welcomed warmly and received great service without anyone batting an eye. I'll be back, hopefully soon.  P.S.

Located in the newer section of the Domain, this place is a nice welcome addition to the area.  They offer the traditionally classic coffee menu with all the drinks you know and love(no frappaccinos here!)  They also have a nice beer selection as well, but with such wonderful coffee aroma in the air the last thing on my mind was beer lol!  I ordered their cappuccino and it was a home run.  Delicious and nutty.. perfectly roasted flavors and tasty frothy foam.  One of the best I've had here in Austin.  They guys behind the counter were really outgoing, energetic and friendly.  They were eager to let us sample some of the drip coffees they had.  I fell in love with their signature roast the most.  Finally my palette is starting to acquire a taste for coffee without all the syrups and creamers and garbage, so I am pretty stoked about buying from places like this.  They also offered the chance to try their beers but after drinking a cappuccino I don't think my stomach would have appreciated it lol!  This will definitely be a go to spot for me besides Red Horn and with great customer service interaction like this,  it's easy to why other locals love this place too.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/6/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Domainatrix This north Austin Domain complex just gets bigger & better. If I were young & foolish again or temporarily deluded by male menopause, I'd get a very cool dog and move here in a flash. In the meantime, Two Hands and $2.49 will get you a good cup of coffee.  If I were a resident I'd give this place five stars and move on. But since I'm not, I'll tell you parking around here can be a little tricky, and your best bet is one of the nearby parking garages. That's when a casual coffee moment becomes a semi-commitment for me, and unless I'm going to other places at the Domain, I'll have to think about it. This may not be an issue for you.  I was curious about this new Rock Rose district, because I thought everyone was talking about Round Rock. They're not. It's almost like they photoshopped the best & brightest parts of West 6th St. and moved it here, with lots of shiny people and very cool dogs. A great lure to the Domain.

The only thing I can think to improve is more outlets near the bar area, otherwise this coffee shop embodies everything I seek in a coffee shop.  The Goods: - dog friendly patio seating. - fresh juices from locally grown fruits & vegetables that is made to order. - bright open welcoming space optimal for working. - located near restaurants, bars and shops. - free parking garage. - open latish for a coffee shop. - they offer happy hour Monday-Friday from 4pm-7pm. $1 off drafts. Speaking of drafts they have a nice lineup of local taps and a selection of both red & white wine. - they serve mimosas with fresh juices (choice of orange or pineapple). - in addition to coffee prepared tons of ways they of course serve iced and hot teas. They also serve Topo Chico and baked goods from a locally owned Quacks bakery.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/15/2016 1 check-in Good playlist, nice ambience, friendly staff, scented bathroom, ample lighting, outlets, and seatings they've got seating outside on a cute patio, seating inside with comfy sofas, intimate tables, and tables that allow you to do work  This place is unreal. It's got the space that none of the other hipster coffee shops can afford, the friendly staff who do not intimidate, furnitures that are not only cute but also great to use (you know those hipster furnitures that hurt your butt and wobble and just never seem to have enough desk space? The ones that probably aren't meant for desk work? Yep. None of that)  The only downs are personal - they're out of my way (perhaps a plus for folks in north Austin) and the latte wasn't as strong as I'd like (though very smooth). Also, not sure if I'm just late to the game at 6pm but they don't seem to have an extensive pastry selection, which can work out to be a pro  alas, I will just have to make another visit to check! :3  I will definitely be back to give the rest of their drink menu a go while enjoying the lovely atmosphere (:  Parking tip- park in the rock rose garage!

Two Hands Coffee has something to offer at any time of the day.  Most days of the week they are open from around 7-10pm.  In the morning, it could be a fresh blended juice made in house.   Lunch, sandwiches and/or salad by Fricanos Deli with a coffee.  In the afternoon, tea by Mighty Leaf, with a pastry by Quack's.  After work, a local beer on tap or wine by the glass.  The seating area is spacious and bright.  They have a few outside tables to sit at as well.  The seating is comfortable, and with free wifi great for students or those working remotely (no password necessary).    This is the first coffee place that I am aware of in the domain area that specializes in pour overs and organic coffee beans from Nicaragua.  They have a partnership that pays local farmers fairly.  There are two different medium roast coffee beans you can choose from.  One is more fruity, and the other more chocolate and nutty in flavor (El Capitan).  Both are delightful and well done.  They blend the two for the espresso.  The green juice here is legit.  It is definitely heavy on the greens, and not sweetened, just like l like it.  They are working on getting some gluten free pastries, currently they offer a coconut macaroon that is wheat free. It was very filling, and good.  The staff are friendly and do their best to keep up with the orders.  They do also have drip coffee for those that like it the American way.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 2/21/2016 7 check-ins Listed in Domain Rock Rose Having walked by Two Hands several times over the last few weeks, we decided to give it a try.    The interior was very open and welcoming with dozens of patrons enjoying the Saturday morning. We had a Chai Latte, Cafe Americano, a pour over coffee, and two pastries.  The Chai was very well executed but lacked character in the chai tea blend used.  Most of the spices were muted with only clove as the dominant flavor.  It wasn't really our cup of tea.  The Americano and pour over were both good, bold, and flavorful.  The high quality of coffee used for both reflected in the final products.  The two pastries we tried were the blueberry scone and banana tea bread - both from Quacks bakery.  The scone was fresh, moist, buttery, and chock full of blueberries.  The banana bread had great flavor but seemed a bit on the dry side.    Overall, this establishment is a great addition to the Domain and the new Rock Rose area providing a nice place to relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee. Cafe Americano Chai Latte ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/17/2016 12 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials I had to check out Two Hands as one of the first businesses to open in the Domain's Rock Rose district.  They offer a range of juices, coffee, wine, and beer on tap. I ordered a hot latte, and tried an iced vanilla latte as well. I enjoyed both - definitely one of the best iced vanilla lattes I have tasted! I did ask for my latte in a to-go cup because I like my coffee to stay hot and was not given one, but that's not a big deal.  The location is beautiful inside and out - I love the minimalist interior and the comfortable seating. It definitely would be an awesome place to study or get work done, and there are large windows for a bright atmosphere.  Interesting that the coffee was delivered to our table directly, rather than called out at the bar - I am wondering how this will work during busy hours but it definitely made an impression.  The owner approached us as we left to introduce himself and let us know he was thankful that we dropped by on opening day which was nice. I also read online that Two Hands reserves a percentage of what they spend on coffee to go straight back to the farmers - much respect!  I would come here again to support the business in the future. pastries by Quacks! pretty latte art! Quack's cinnamon roll! yummy See all photos from Hanna J. for Apanas Coffee & Beer ", pos

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 7/4/2016 Listed in ATX Coffee Fix The ambience is a definite five stars--plenty of electrical outlets here as well as lots of natural lighting. The baristas are friendly, but I've noticed on more than one occasion that miscommunication, or lack thereof, seemed to be an issue here.  One time, I had made an order and waited 8-10 minutes (the person who had made an order before already received hers 5 minutes prior). I went up and asked about my order and the barista realized the person taking orders never gave her the slip for my order. In the end, the situation was rectified but this mistake was something worth noting especially since it was not busy that time of day.  On another visit, I had asked for an iced coffee (specifically requested a drip coffee with ice--I know, I'm weird), I noticed the charge not equaling what was on the menu. I had then asked the lady taking the order and she said she was going to charge me for a cold brew. Looking back at this situation, it would have been nice if she said this upfront rather than me having to ask.  In the end, Apanas, once known as Two Hands, is far from perfect. However, with these flaws, I'll still be returning for the nice atmosphere and decent coffee. ", neutral

A friend and I spent the afternoon here - both inside and outside, very comfortably, discussing life.  We both ordered iced lattes - and while we both thought they were decent, they seemed mildly bitter. Outside, they have plenty of tables to lounge in, cordoned off from the street by a small fence. Inside, they have a smattering of couches, tables, and lounging areas with a separated nook in the back with a few tables itself.  I like Apanas, and I'd definitely come back here.

I've only recently gotten into coffee and was excited to see a glass beaker style brewing setup, sort of like a chemex on their counter tops.  Two Hands Coffee uses top quality coffee that they source personally, they're very excited to talk to you about it!  The coffee prices are fair, they offer beer and wine, fresh pressed juice, and also baked goods from Quack's.  The coffee has rich, slightly acidic flavor, because they really give their coffee time to bloom with the method they're using and the smell in the air is intoxicating.  The caffeine menu is straightforward.  Only one size offered, but with many different creamer choices, including coconut, which I highly recommend if you like coconut flavor and want a nuttier sweetness added to your coffee without the sugar.  If you are persnickety about coffee and near the Domain, Two Hands could not be a better choice.  I rank them amongst my top 5 of Austin coffee shops. ", pos

The usual hipsters people on computers and baked goods that came from somewhere else. I don't want to hate but the espressos and lattes I get from the barista at Lexus for free are just as good and not cause it's free but genuinely because it's the same thing. I was expecting a lil bit more unique flavored coffee from all the hype or some variation of whatever the best coffee in Austin would taste like if that's even a thing. I think this is another super hype I don't go to Starbucks cause it's a chain hipster gathering spot with regular coffee.

I can't tell if I've just been ordering the wrong things. I've had everything from their espresso based drinks to their drip coffee to their teas and muffins. Baked goods are delicious and not made in house. Both their drip coffees were VERY sour - so sour that I thought it was the creamer. The lattes are unspectacular and not that kind of gorgeous smooth rich taste I would expect from a fancy place like this. There was that acidic aftertaste. Their teas just taste nondescript. I never finished mine. To top it all off, this place is pretty pricy.  Their decor looks nice but isn't exactly the most comfortable. I wasn't a huge fan of their patio chairs on the inside set up, as the chairs dug into my thighs. There are only plugs along the wall. Seats become scarce the moment the populous wakes up i.e. any time that's not 8am. All of which are things I would live with it they had better coffee.  I do love their music choice though!

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/23/2016 1 check-in Well, okay, maybe this place deserves five stars. But I've only had one thing on the menu here, so I don't want to get ahead of myself.  I wish Two Hands Coffee was just a little bit closer because I pretty much love it here. The interior is beautiful, spacious, brightly lit, and provides a really welcoming atmosphere with good music softly playing in the background. Good amount of open seats near outlets on a Tuesday evening. The baristas were very friendly--I mean, I didn't talk to them much but sometimes you walk into a place, and you kinda get the wrong vibe, if you know what I mean? Not here. Not even close. And they bring out your drink to you, which is so nice.  They serve a variety of things in addition to coffee: beer, wine, juice, pastries, sandwiches. My classic to-go drink is an iced vanilla latte, which was great (a tad on the sweeter side). I'm looking forward to trying their other items because it's such a great place to study or even just to just grab a cup of coffee (or beer) with your friends.  Also, they have a really cute patio for those who want to bask in good weather.  My only complaint is that if it gets loud, it resonates kind of fast because everything bounces off the concrete floor and wooden panels. Maybe if there were more sound absorbing material somewhere?

Most of the tables are can seat 2-4 people. Bathroom was pretty clean, no complaints about anything.  The coffee was okay. Nothing crazy. Some of the other reviews have said that it was very sharp. I can't deny that point. The coffee is better than the stuff that you could make at home (for an average person, not a coffee connoisseur), however it's not anything I'd come back for.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 5/9/2016 My buddy and I have met here twice in the past week to grab coffee and talk. I love the atmosphere of this place! As most have mentioned there is plenty of natural lighting coming in through lots of big windows! There is plenty of seating inside and an outdoor area as well with tables and a wrap around bar that has bar stools. They offer a good selection of wine and beer, and of course coffee! I really enjoy their coffee and will continue to frequent this spot!  Today, we met Amil(spelling?), the owner! He is a very pleasant guy and had plenty to tell us about the coffee and where it comes from. Their espresso is smooth and flavorful and they make all the classic coffee drinks!  Love everything; the beverages, the atmosphere, the location, the design! ", pos

Besides the alcohol and the awesome space these guys really care about their coffee which makes me feel good about being a patron here. Luckily I live close by and can beat the lunch time crowd. I recommend coming before 11:30 am and you shouldn't have a problem finding a seat or waiting in line. But even during the lunch rush the line moves quickly and there are able bodied baristas behind the counter. , pos

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/23/2016 1 check-in I've started coming here twice a week to study, and really like it. Chill vibe and the drinks are pretty good- a bit pricey for a student's budget, but ethical, so I can deal. I can see myself coming here for awhile! Definitely would recommend if you're in the area. Plan on parking in the garage about two blocks away, fyi. Great place to study. Good music good vibes, decent amount of plugs lol ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/16/2016 Went here for breakfast one Saturday morning about a week after it opened in Rock Rose.  Ordered a pour over and it tasted amazing.  Also ordered pastries, which were great - while not made in house, they bring them in daily from quacks (which is perfectly fine by me).  It was quiet and laid back, but definitely had a steady stream of traffic coming through the door.  I am definitely interested to go back during happy hour (or a more reasonable drinking hour) as they appear to have a nicely curated beer selection as well.  So happy there is a better alternative to Starbucks in the Domain now. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/26/2016 Finally, a quality cup of coffee in North Austin (The Domain).  I had to either go downtown or to Houndstooth (Midtown) to get a decent cup of coffee in this city.    Great staff. Friendly.  Good prices.  Great vibe.  The owner sat and got to know me for 20 minutes while he was super busy.   Definitely a community place. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/1/2016 When I first visited this coffee shop, I was thinking about making it my go-to study spot. Although it can get noisy, I thought I discovered the absolute perfect coffee shop in North Austin. I can still say that I do like the atmosphere, that their coffee is delicious, and that their staff is extremely friendly.  However, I don't think I'll be returning after tonight. My table was approached by a person (presumably the owner/manager) who announced to everyone in my area (but actually @ me) that in the future, he'd appreciate it if we (I) purchased something, even if it's small, since we're (I'm) using their Wi-Fi & taking up a table. Yes, I do see that those are very valid points, however, I have mixed feelings about them even being addressed (and particularly about the manner in which he approached it). So I'm now writing this review from my iPad while on my iPhone's personal hotspot lol.  In my opinion, I think customers help a business in very direct (purchasing a product) and indirect ways. On one hand, I hadn't been buying and probably wouldn't have bought a coffee or snack every time I studied here (which would have been pretty often since I was intent on being a regular). On the other hand, I was sold on everything about their coffee shop and raved to others about how great it is, that they should try it, etc.  So how many times can I go without purchasing before I have to buy again? Is there some sort of coffee shop etiquette I'm not aware of? (These are not sarcastic questions btw). I think tonight marked my 4th visit, and to be honest, I was thinking about buying a latte before I was approached.  Maybe I'm just used to waltzing into my local noisy Starbucks and studying there without purchasing something like *ever*... but I guess I'll be returning there to study from now on.  I may come back when I'm over this, but for now, I'll pass on Two Hands Coffee and I'll probably tell my friends to do the same.  (But if you go, do try their latte with hazelnut. It's delicious.)

Patio is seating is a plus. They also offer almond as well as soy milk to go with coffee (which tasted great). Impressed. I will be back! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 8/17/2016 Apanas is definitely my go-to place. Coffee is always tasty, food is fresh, beer choices are eclectic and there are healthy options... Plus, everything is priced really well. The service, though, is why I keep coming back. Every single employee is pleasant and there's a guy named Chris that takes it upon himself to learn the names of customers. I truly believe that his laid back, friendly energy is what contributes to the chill environment and consistent flow of business I see every time I'm there. Oh, and the music is on-point EVERY time.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/12/2016 Wow THC fits right in with the Domain. It's a nice coffee shop in the middle of an otherwise bustling plaza.  Quick tip for parking - go to the garages on the sides of the plaza. I was dumb and spent way too much time than I'd care to admit looking for parking cause I'm too used to Austin's pay-till-you're-broke parking.  The coffee here is on point. I had one of their pourovers, which was extremely smooth, but NOT acidic. I've also heard wonderful things about their latte as well.  My only slight issue is that seating can get limited and lighting is a bit dimmer than I'd like (I'm a student, but the really rare breed that uses many textbooks still...), but it's not like I'm squinting to read.  Definitely check this place out, especially if you'll be in the area for other fun times in the Domain! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 7/29/2016 I'm not a big fan of the Domain, but the Rock Rose section is ok and this coffee shop is pretty groovy, so I've been a number of times. The baristas have always been friendly and my drinks were good. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/19/2016 1 check-in Located in the new phase 3 development of the Domain, this coffee shop is a great addition to the shopping center. The Rock Rose area has a different look and atmosphere than the rest of the Domain and Two Hands Coffee is a perfect fit. The ambiance is inviting and the staff is very friendly and helpful. On my first visit two of the staff members introduced themselves and made an effort to get to know me.  Not only is the coffee superb, but they also offer beer and juices. The juices are made on the spot using local fruit and vegetables.  This was the perfect place to get some work done as well. This may change if the place becomes more popular though. If the service and products remain as good as I experienced, there's no doubt that the business will continue to grow. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 3/13/2016 Really good coffee. We got a cappuccino and a pour over and they were both excellent. Unlike many coffee places that merely go thru the motions, they seem to take great care at pulling their shots, resulting in delicious flavors instead of that burnt nastiness some places expect you to believe is norm. Their cappucino finished with lingering sweetness kind of like maple syrup.  The people were also very friendly. We bought a bag of their Los Pinos coffee beans on the way out. Too bad they didnt have their espresso blend available to purchase but we will just go back again for next time. ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/22/2016 This wonderful little place is a short walk from my job. I braved the cold and wind this morning and walked over and I'm so glad that I did. I love this place!! First, it is nestled in the growing avenue of Rock Rose and I'm so excited to see what else is coming. If the quality and ambiance of Two Hands is any example of what is coming then they are on point 100%.  I decided to order two items just to get a sample of their menu. I ordered a Mixed Greens Juice and a Chai Tea Latte. The Chai is delicious, just the right amount of spice, it was the perfect temperature and blows the socks off any I can remember. The Mixed Greens Juice is really good, really fresh and flavorful.  The prices are not too bad, the Chai was $4 and the Mixed Greens was $7. I noticed that they had a nice offering of salads and sandwiches on their menu. They also offer an assortment of baked goods. Their drinks menu has plenty to choose from and I am excited to keep trying it all out.  The best part for me was the service. The owner and the sweet lady at the counter were both welcoming, friendly and talkative. They made me feel like I wanted to stay and have a chat with them.  Anyone that chooses to go to the Starbucks a few streets over is out of their mind. This place has everything a coffee place could offer. The interior was inviting and well decorated. Nothing about Two Hands feels generic. It is a perfect addition and I can't wait to go back! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer , 1/22/2016 What can I say about two hands! It's so BEAUTIFUL. The attention to detail is so thoughtful and the quality of the product is outstanding! Talking with Aamil the owner is so fun he is kind and so knowledgable! He has a passion for his products and even gives back to some of the farmers! He has 6 tap handles of all craft beer and a list of fresh juices which is perfect for someone like me who doesn't love coffee as much as my Boyfriend does! They even have happy hour Monday-Friday -$1.00 draft beer... I'm in heaven! Keep up the great work Two Hands! We will be back :) Beautiful Latte! Owner Aamil. Paradise juice !! , pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 1/18/2016 10 check-ins The Domain in Austin offers a variety of stores to shop, places to eat, and things to do. However, the location does little to offer for coffee other than Starbucks, the Steeping Room and restaurant coffee. Until now  Two Hands Coffee is a coffee shop my girlfriend, who already posted a review that is probably more insightful and enjoyable to read, recommended to me (by that I mean forced to tag along). The shop sits on Rock Rose ave, a hidden road that will be filled with new stores in the Domain. At first glance upon the minimal yet appealing decor, I knew I was in for a treat.  I took my gf and two sisters to try this place out. We ordered two vanilla iced lattes, a special Juice (I forget the name but I remember the price of $7) and a hot latte for about $20, fairly priced! I noticed that their bakery options are from Quacks, which is a local bakery near me that I often enjoy a pie or two. Coffee was good and to everyone's liking, but most importantly the juice apparently made my sister feel healthier within 5 minutes of drinking it. Wow  The vast interior and high ceilings give an open, relaxed vibe to the shop. Order your drinks/food, get handed a number and find a relaxing seat next to their huge window or a nice table with friends and a few minutes later someone will come out and bring your order to you. First time I've experienced this in a coffee shop!  Upon leaving, the manager/owner (i'm not too sure) came up to greet and thank us for our visit! An extremely nice gesture that gave me the extra push to declare this neat coffee shop as my new go-to coffee shop outside of home! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 6/21/2016 2 check-ins This is one of my new favorite go-to places in Austin for coffee. Previously known as Two Hands, Apanas is great for coffee and beer/wine drinkers. I especially like that they offer both options because I have a couple of friends that don't drink so this place caters to both of our moods :) They also have juices and pastries as well so it's more than just your typical coffee shop. The vibe is cool and the staff is superb! I've gone on both week nights and weekend nights and have always had a pleasant experience. Sometimes there is a musician playing live music which is always delightful. I highly recommend stopping here. Only downfall is that the close ""15 minute parking"" section isn't always open to the public, and the parking garages are kinda far from the shop itself. So if you plan to stop in ""quick"" to get coffee on-the-go, it may take you about 15 minutes just to find a parking spot and then walk there. Otherwise, I'm still happy to go back. I just need to be sure I have enough time alloted! ", pos

So as a coffee house it does what it's supposed to do !  As much as I wanted to i could not take away two stars (felt really mean to do that ) for two major faults (one because of the location and two, well.. )  1. Parking is a nightmare if you plan to come here during weekends. This Is because of the location,I understand so I did not take away the star. Haven't been here during weekdays so don't know how the situation is then.  2. INTERNET connection issues.. now a days coffee shops have become more of a working spots than just coffee drinking spot.. and it feels that their Internet just poops out if there are too many people in the spot.

Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 2/29/2016 I am their biggest fan of both the coffee and the juice. I'm talking about freshly made juice that lucky for me is heavy handed on the veggies instead of just being full of sugar.  Do yourself a favor and order yourself a Mighty Greens. Their coffee is just simply delicious. No bitterness ever. One day I will move past their caramel lattes to try something else like the excellent pour over coffee that everyone raves about, but for now I'm happy with my lattes. Aamil the owner is such a pro when it comes to hospitality.  You can tell he cares and you'll usually see him working his butt off and interacting with customers.  You won't find any cranky too cool for school baristas working here.  The staff is nothing short of amazing.  Everyone is really approachable and will offer suggestions.

The baristas have been very friendly both times I went.  Its in the Domain, which is one of my least favorite places in the world to go, but its in the new Rock Rose section of the Domain, which is a little more tolerable.  That said, its relatively close to my house....  Ive ordered pourovers both times and theyre ok. Their coffee isnt great, but its certainly above average and they have the best beans you can get north of 2222 (where you can get Wild Gift at Thunderbird).

Guess suburb population tends to appreciate yummy sugary coffee flavored milkshake way more than real coffee.  In Austin, Houndstooth was my favorite , but a bit far from mine and it's N. Lamar location does not have enough tables for work. I am so please to find Two Hands, and now I go there every weekend for work, even though it still takes me 15 minutes to get there.

Corona Coffee ," 8/31/2015 4 check-ins ROTD 1/24/2016 Ok, this is the most authentic, anti-corporate, true coffee shop I have ever been to.  Naimen is the owner/operator and the most knowledgeable person on coffee I have ever met.  If this isn't obvious in the craftsmanship he applies to his trade, then you aren't a true coffee fan. If you continue to visit and listen to his coffee conversations, you can't help but learn a ton.    Now for the coffee...I am a traditional coffee person.   I like my coffee black, no cream, no sugar; so yes, I am boring.   I find those that order their triple half-caff double Chia latte with cinnamon revolting people that talk more about themselves, the Kardashians, vaccinations and whatever other mindless nonsensical fad happens to be popular.  You can find these people at the green and white place happily displaying their latest technology as a status symbol, but I digress.    I was so impressed with Naiman's knowledge I threw caution to the wind and left my coffee experience in his hands.  He had no clue that I liked my coffee plain Jane with the only question being ""whole milk?"", to which I said ""yes.""   After the typical slam bang of the espresso machine I was presented with the non-descript white cup with the to-go lid in place.  I didn't care to take the lid off top to see what was inside as the first sip would tell me more than any visual.  As I take that first sip, he asks, ""So?""  My mind is now seriously confused.   I detected a bit of mocha but the strength of the espresso bean and the silky smooth sensation of real whole milk froth.   I ponder the fact that I like this; no, I REALLY like this.  My response is a guarded one of ""Café Mocha but there is something strange and delicious."" His response startled me.  Naimen revels to my shock and horror that I just had a ""BLACKBERRY LATTE!""  I think to myself, how can this be?  I am a normal blue collar coffee type!  I am not a one bite fruit guy.  I love my droid and my Linux and my old school punk and all things anti-latte, yet I somehow love this blend.   The elegance of the blackberry syrup made and espresso bean creating a slight hint of Mocha combined with the smoothness of whole milk is a testament to molecular gastronomy.  I have now come to the conclusion that as long as a craftsmen is true to their craft, I can respect that.  I can not only respect it, I can admire it.  Corona Café is a true rarity and certainly respects that art of coffee brewing and blending.   While the green and whites are painting by number, Naimen is a true artist.

He's like a mixologist with coffee. He was training a new barista when I arrived so I got the pleasure to hear him talk a bit about the chemistry of the decisions he was making while brewing.  Ordered the Blackberry Dark Mocha and holy crap, one of the best coffees I've had. Not too sweet with lots of flavor. Most coffee shops cover up the lack of complexity in their coffee drinks with more sugar, which I hate.  Wish I was living in Austin again to hit this place up every day. Come here and you won't be disappointed. ", pos 
Corona Coffee , 11/5/2016 1 check-in This guy knows his stuff. I love that they offer a wide variety of ad ins and the different types of milk (ie: almond milk etc.) I had the Apollo (blackberry orange dark chocolate mocha) Delicious! Husband had the cinnamon cappuccino which was also super yummy! Try this place out! Going back tomorrow , pos 
Corona Coffee ," 9/22/2016 I came here because of the good reviews on yelp. I'm always in the area and I'm starting to realize how overrated Starbucks can be. So I decided to give this little place a try. I was not disappointed. I was greeted as soon as I walked in. I already knew what I wanted, the orange dark chocolate mocha but still took a look in the menu to confirm the name of the drink. It's called JUPITER. It's pretty cool, the whole menu is based on planets and solar system. My drink was delicious!! I paid $5.50 for a medium size. The owner introduced himself and he seemed to really put a lot of attention and he made sure the drink was made to perfection. He told me, ""I hope you love it"" and went on to tell me how everything is made by him, the process of the orange syrup and all. I was defiantly impressed! I will defiantly be back!! ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 11/30/2015 Listed in Lunch Austin!, Four Star+ Coffee I'm writing this as I sip on some kind of magic latte that Naiman created for me after I dragged my haggard behind into Corona for some caffeine. (Normally I get a chlorophyll and green tea latte with almond milk, but today called for some extra oomph. I was clearly not disappointed.) As he described it, it tastes exactly like gingerbread. I agree, but it's 800x better than any gingerbread I've ever had. He also said, ""It's sometimes just really nice to have the time to make something special for someone."" Can it get better than that? Can it?!  Some other bright spots about Corona: they make a lot of their own flavors from scratch (the blackberry syrup is fantastic, and so is the long-brewed cinnamon/clove tea). (Edit: I previously thought they roast their own beans...someone who doesn't work there told me that! See Naiman's comment below. Does not change my opinion.) I found out today that the condensed milk is handmade. A lot of the baked goods are as well. They serve sandwiches from Fricano's that are delicious.  I highly recommend Corona to literally anyone with tastebuds. Just go. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 7/12/2016 This is my new go-to coffee stop! Awesome cold brew with many choices for flavors (if you're into that like me.)

Dark chocolate mocha + blackberry flavored cold brew. Very fresh, flavorful, and not too sweet. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 8/14/2016 I've been to a lot of coffee places all over the country, this one didn't wow me. When I waked in I was overwhelmed with the smell of cleaning supplies and incense or something to that effect. The ambience was kind of bland but the lady behind the counter was pleasant. Coffee was good but not amazing. I think the whole feel was a little lack luster and we got two mochas a large and a small for $11.00. Very nice person working but wouldn't go back. ", neutral

Corona Coffee ," 8/6/2016 1 check-in Don't judge a book by its cover. This place is located in a small strip mall in a run down area. When you walk it, complete 180. Fun, vibing place with an extremely friendly barista/owner. My wife and I went with the Blackberry Dark Mocha - drink was real smooth with no syrup bite which is huge for me. Subtle berry tons with creamy follow through. Highly recommend this place, it is worth a 10-15 min detour if you are located on the west side of town. ", pos

We came in on a Sunday around 1p for our first dose of caffeine and were not disappointed. The barista was a female with a calm, courteous, and just straight up 'good-people' demeanor: awesome! There was a short wait when we came in--no biggie! It's a smaller coffee shop with a single person on staff taking orders and making the drinks. The actual beverage I got was super tasty--I could still discern the flavor of the roasted espresso and it wasn't overwhelmed by the soy or syrup. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 8/15/2015 After recently moving to Austin, I've been looking for a cafe that can replace my old one. The selection and quality of the coffee was very good. The overall vibe of the place is very hipster and the music selection helps create that ambiance.  My biggest complaint of this cafe, is that there wasn't much in the way of comfy seating. Was looking for a place to sit, read, and drink some coffee. All there was were your standard hard chairs and tables and one couch. However, the couch is just as uncomfortable.  Overall, the coffee and selection made up for the seating arrangement making this a good coffee shop to visit on your way to work! ", neutral 
Corona Coffee ," 5/31/2015 I just moved to the area and figured that I would take some visiting friends with me on my first trip to check this place out.  In short? We love this cafe.  It's intimate, not Starbucks-busy, and within walking distance. One friend ordered the house-developed green tea chai. The owner even took the time to describe the flavors with which he crafted this chai. (It's worth noting that the owner appeared to be pretty down-to-earth with no hint of pretentiousness, which is very welcome for an indie cafe!)  New favorite local coffee shop, hands-down. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 3/27/2015 Love this place! Came here on my first day of my Austin trip, and will be coming back every day to get me going. I was warmly greeted and quickly became friendly with Naiman, Bridget, and Dabne. Absolutely feels like your friends' place, making you drinks!  That said, if you want to study/work, and not chat with people, you should probably bring headphones. Obviously I like the community and conversation.  I recommend the green tea chai latte, and one of their specialties, the Harvest Moon-- honey hazelnut latte. But all of their specialty drinks sound divine!  Food wise, they stock lots of yummy local muffins, sandwiches, burritos, etc. I loved their tomato-mozzarella sandwich, but I hear their breakfast tacos are rad. Gonna have to get one tomorrow.  If you're looking for good drinks, friends, and ambience, I can't recommend this place more! :) ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 5/14/2015 I have been to pretty much every locally owned coffee shop in Austin, and this one definitely exceeds my usual expectations by a long shot. All of their flavors and syrups are made by them, and they are really amazing flavors, like blackberry and lavender. I had the blackberry white mocha and my sister had the salted caramel latte/mocha (I forget which!). Both were really, really delicious. I like coffee drinks that don't have an overpowering taste of coffee, and are more flavorful than outright sweet. The drinks weren't just loaded with sugar, but carefully made to taste delicious and refreshing. I seriously cannot wait to go back. It's a tiny little place in a small shopping center, so parking could definitely be an issue, but there were tons of spot on the late weekday afternoon I went. Thanks to the barista for being so great as well!  Oh, and their muffins are really good. I'm not sure if they were homemade or vegan, but they tasted like they were both. Yum! Beware, they close at 5pm on weekdays. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 6/5/2014 7 check-ins Quaint locally owned coffee shop.  I never would have thought it was here but for randomly seeing it when my husband and I spontaneously decided to drive around the surrounding neighborhood about a month ago.  We wanted to check it out, but it was closed at the time.    I had an early morning meeting today and decided to stop by after.   The staff is super friendly and helpful.  I had the iced Luna, and it was perfection.  Also had some breakfast tacos which are from Tex Mex off of Manor.  I absolutely loved the black bean, egg, and cactus taco.  Will need to check them out with the hubby sometime.    I have been frequenting the Star Bucks off Barbara Jordan (Mueller Area) for sometime now, but with this place just a few blocks away from there, I think I found a new morning spot.  They were not too busy, so it was easy to find a table and there are plenty of outlets for you to charge your phones, laptops, and other devices. I definitely would recommend this place and encourage you to GO LOCAL. They close at 3, so Star Bucks may keep my loyalty in the evenings. See all photos from Renee D. for Corona Coffee ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 4/10/2015 I just discovered Corona Cafe and I wish I had found it sooner!  I live close by but discovered it by chance when traffic was particularly backed up and I hadn't taken the time to make coffee at home. It's tucked away on a side street off of Cameron Road in a nondescript row of businesses, perfect for the neighborhood.  The vibe is wonderful and everyone there is friendly! I talked to the barista and two costumers as my order was taken and felt genuinely welcomed. The shop has an authenticity about it that's refreshing.  I've only gotten their drip coffee (super affordable, flat $2 for a good sized cup) and a tasty almond poppyseed muffin, but both were worth the price. Based on other people's reviews I'd like to try some other drinks rather than my usual drip coffee. I will definitely be making more coffee pit stops here! ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 1/28/2015 1 check-in This is a cute little coffee shop just off Cameron Road close to The Nomad.  I'm a daily brew gal for the most part, and when I'm super fancy I go for an Americano--- no room for cream necessary.  In a pinch I will drink just about any coffee, but I typically stick to the good stuff.  I consider this place some of the good stuff. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 2/16/2015 3 check-ins Ok, so the first time I came here I just dropped in to grab a cup of coffee and something with espresso for my best friend's drive back home from Austin.  I wasn't really planning on being a fan of this place, but then we walked in, loved the vibe and both of us were almost immediately talked into trying the horchata with espresso (which, might I add, didn't take much convincing). The horchata is made in house with almond milk and is the bees knees. Ask for a sample!  Naiman (sp?), the owner, is awesome and makes tons of stuff in house from scratch - anything from syrups to horchata! They're the ""Corona"" items on the menu, you'll notice them for the creativity.  So, now that I've been a few times I can definitely say I'm hooked on two things: 1) Horchatte and 2) double brewed green tea w/ chlorophyll.  Try them. And all the other drinks because I'm sure they're great! Just wish they had better food options. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 12/30/2014 Dude. I can't even.  This place is really amazing. Atmosphere, Drinks (Best Cold Brew in town, hands down), Tacos, Staff. All A+++. Family owned and run, this neighborhood shop has got your favorite chain beat. Just try it once, you'll be amazed.  Atmosphere: It's hidden in a small strip mall, and if you blink you'll miss it. So, don't blink because its totally worth it. Inside is warm and cozy, and always has great music on. There is also a selection of local handmade hats, scarves and jewelry. Yeah, that's right. The noise level is usually pretty quite, with occasional crowds that make it get to the average level, but there always a few people working on their laptops so the noise level stays pretty low.  Drinks: So this is where they really shine and what ultimately drew me in as a regular. The cold brew here is stunning, and it takes a lot to impress me. I've driven all over this town and tried everyone's cold brew. Then I found Corona, and it changed my life. I know that sounds dramatic, and it is. But it's also true. Talking with the management about their approach to coffee, it becomes quite clear that they take this sh*t seriously! Their knowledge and skills are unparalleled. Other than the cold brew, they have a whole assortment of gourmet drinks. And I mean, Gour-freaking-met! The Pulsar (caramel mocha with himalayan salt) is my favorite. But the Corona Borealis (Kashmiri green tea chai latte topped with fresh saffron, cardamom and cinnamon) is my other favorite. Freaking Saffron!  Tacos: They carry Taco-Mex tacos. The migas is delicious, but the egg, cactus and black bean is also very popular. The spicy green salsa is creamy and delicious!  Staff: They are all so knowledgeable and friendly. This family establishment really cares about their customers and you will see it in the numerous regulars that come and go all day. I always have a great time when I come here. Which is about four times a week. Check it out. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 11/1/2014 The vibe is so chill here, I'm thinking I'll bring my pillow next time and have a nap.  Good coffee, quality sandwiches. Not a huge menu, but they make what they got count. I've heard good things about their breakfast tacos, but they were sold out when I went. But hey, it was noon already, so that's on me.  The husband/wife owners have created a cool, little spot here in a not so cool strip mall. This corner is kinda beat down. But you get inside the cafe and all is warm and cozy. The husband works the counter and makes you feel like you just walked into your own kitchen and he's there to fix you something to eat and drink.  Cool-ass place! ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 4/10/2012 13 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", ""These are my 'Coolest' reviews?"" Hmmm... Let me tell you what this place is not:  1.  It's not your mama's coffeehouse. 2.  It's not Breakfast at Tiffany's. 3.  If this is your hood, it could very well be the best part of waking up, without Folgers in your cup.  Second, you need to know the family that runs this place keeps it open from 7am to 3pm, Monday through Friday. And that's it. This is somewhat unique because:  A) They like spending their time doing family stuff together, rather than increasing business revenue. B)  It's a happy family. You'll know it when you chat with them. C)  I'm not sure how far the ""Family First"" concept flies these days at Wharton.  Yes, it probably gets backed up here during a typical morning rush, and they're always tweaking stuff like menu items and pre-packaged brown bag fare for you to carryout quickly. But if you do have a little time, consider stopping in here for a moment or two: I'm simply fascinated with people who run a business and do what they do because by gosh and golly, it's exactly what they want to do, and not just another job or something else in life to complain about.  I had originally planned to give Corona Café four-stars for being what they are - an unexpected gem of a coffeehouse hidden in a strip mall. That in itself makes them special. But it occurred to me, as I was hanging there on a Monday afternoon with an Americano and chatting about families and business and stuff, that this place might actually be an unexpected reality check, a brief respite for a ""stop and smell the roses"" moment. It was obviously more the scent of espresso than roses, of course, but I left there thinking, this just might be as good as it gets. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 1/19/2015 Friendly, funky place.  The Pulsar (caramel mocha) is outstanding.

Corona Coffee ," 5/20/2013 ROTD 8/18/2013 Corona is exactly the type of small neighborhood coffee shop that I am happy to support. The building is not the fanciest. You won't find granite fixtures and snooty leather chairs.  You will find a business owner who is absolutely passionate about coffee and taking care of customers. I thought I knew a fair bit about coffee until I talked the owner. I know nothing, Jon Snow.  That said, espresso is serious business to me. I am crippling my financial future, shorting my retirement, and eliminating a number of pricey private schools from my children's futures because of the amount of money I spend on espresso. Good espresso matters, and, when done well, it can be sublime.  I am heavily biased toward shops that use Cuvee beans (a local artisanal treasure and a shining example of what is right in the Austin food scene), so I was skeptical about Corona using different beans. I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the drinks at Corona. The beans from Trianon, turned into a delicious rich espresso. The drink was great and a nice change of pace from the Cuvee that I drink almost every day.  To folks in the Mueller / Capital Plaza area, you should be patronizing this shop. If you are getting your daily fix at Starbucks or, gag, McDonalds, then you are making a terrible mistake. Come out and support an underdog and get superior coffee in the process. It's a win win. I'll drink a double to that. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 6/26/2013 12 check-ins A great little coffee shop and cafe located 20 feet from Nomad bar on Corona Dr. at Cameron Rd. Owner Naiman Rigby and his perpetually pleasant staff serve up quality cups of love and do it with a smile every time.  Come here for some really top notch java (roasted & purchased locally in the nghd). The espresso is bold and always pulled to precision. The hot drip coffee and cold brewed toddys have exceptional levels of flavor. Try them first without your milk preference - I promise you'll be surprised at how superior Naiman's offerings are to your typical cup of joe.  They also offer Horchata (yup), hand crafted Kashmir chai, refreshing fruit seltzers (""agua frescas"") and syrups - ALL are made in the store. Like I said, Corona is all about quality drinks.  Arrive hungry as well. There are soups made in store from mama's recipes, made to order sammies, fruit & yogurt parfaits, breakfast tacos and pressed paninis to name some choices. Always ask what the chef has prepared today.  If it sounds like walking into Corona Cafe will leave you spoiled for choices on good food and great drinks then you are correct. It's a nice problem to have and Naiman and his staff will happily deliver you to flavor satisfaction.  Come chat with a friend, get some laptop work done or pop in for a quick caffeine fix. Either way, break the chains and come patronize this local gem! Deli sandwiches. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 7/23/2014 Naiman is the owner here, and he does a really good job of making you feel like family. I've been here twice now, and I feel completely comfortable dropping off my computer  on a big table and walking back outside to get even more equipment where I can set up my work station. I have taken full advantage of the free WIFI (better than at home, insanely, since I live in the neighborhood) and camaraderie.  For example, the first time I was here a mere two days ago, I met Marcus, who was working on a short film about bees... even though he knows zip about bees.  Then, the next time, I met Jeff... Jeff works at Nomad Bar.  He can SING! How do I know this? We sang together... at the coffee shop. Out loud. Naiman can sing too!!  We sang ""Rainbow Connection!""  All of us under its spell... we know that it's probably magic!!  Corona Cafe is magic. Like rainbows! Visit and check in to get 10% off. Or don't and pitch in to keep Naiman's dream alive!

Corona Coffee ," 4/11/2013 5 check-ins I had a short informal meeting here and I was super nervous, but the owner's friendly face was so relaxing during the ordering process that I ended up having a pleasant time! I really like the casual warm atmosphere with sturdy wood tables and they are spaced far enough for a little privacy.  I ordered the Waikiki sneaky- organic fair trade coffee with salted caramel and frothy milky foam. I wasn't tempted by their baked goods for some reason, but the coffee was delicious and a good price. I'm usually a late night coffeehouse goer, but since I am in the area every week I could definitely see this being my place for the occasional coffee fix. Great addition to the neighborhood and the family running it are a delight. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 4/11/2014 Yeah, I hear they have excellent coffee. But I can actually think of at least 3 really good reasons to go there that have nothing to do with coffee:  1) As someone who doesn't often drink caffeine, I really appreciate their awesome selection of non-caffeinated drinks. (A lot of cafes only serve the same old, boring mint and chamomile teas). They have something called the 'Supernova' which is lemon-lime echinacea (with, I think, blackberry syrup) that is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted.  2) This is a family owned and run place, where everyone is super nice.  I really enjoy going here for the sweet, and down to earth folks who work there.  3) They have my favorite kind of breakfast tacos! (Its the kind with cactus and black bean and egg, if you really want to know). ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 3/28/2015 Honestly I wanted to cry after coming here for the first time, in the best of ways. I really hate this word, but this place just feels so GENUINE. I ordered a chlorophyll latte which was so-so, and they have some tasty breakfast tacos, but the real pull is the people. I came here after dropping my brother off at the high school nearby, and realized that this is where all the teachers come before class to talk about how much they hate Greg Abbott, how the economy is fucked, and just in general talk about being liberal educators and how difficult saving the youth is. Highly recommended for people-listening and pretending to read your book. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 4/7/2012 42 check-ins Listed in 78723: East Central, Coffee addicts, step up! It's sort of like walking into the Twilight Zone when you step in here. One minute, you're in the hood and the next minute you're inside a genie's bottle. I found myself here for the first time recently. And I've most definitely been back since my first visit. It sort of feels like you're walking into someone's home, and all their regular friends are there just hanging out and talking. I believe I was greeted by the owner, who was very nice and informed me of their offerings. I came in close to closing time (3PM) and ordered a large iced coffee, unsweetened and no room for cream (that's how I roll, black as night). It was delicious and I sat down for a bit trying to figure out what the wi-fi password was. Then I remembered I live 5 seconds away and there really was no need to find it out at that moment.  But really, I like this café a lot. It's in a strange shopping center right before you enter an older neighborhood. In fact, you can find it in the same place as Nomad. No problem parking here, there's also the lot in the back. Always somewhere to sit, since this place is kind of a secret. Friendly family that runs it, friendly customers, smack dab in the middle of the hood on the eastside? And I could totally walk, if you think it's safe. I'm in. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 10/14/2014 Quaint, locally-owned coffee shop with great service and breakfast tacos. Oh, and coffee as well. With all the national chains nearby, it's nice to have this little place as an option nestled in Windsor Park. My only wish was that it was open a little earlier than 9 on the weekends. A must-stop if you're in the neighborhood! ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 12/7/2013 Listed in Coffee Shop Adventure Best new discovery!  I have heard about this place and driven by, but this is the first time I went inside.  What a GREAT vibe, super friendly barista, lots of seating.  They've taken a boring strip-center-esque place and added so much warmth and color inside.  (Wall art is by his mother-in-law!)  I told the owner off-handedly I was visiting my bucket-list of coffee shops this month.  He said to contact him directly if there was anything he could change or if my coffee wasn't ""perfect"" to me.  Man... that's skin in the game!  I guess you can say that if you really do deliver 5 star service!  I can't believe this is so close to my house and I am just being blessed w/ the discovery.  Will return as soon as my caffeine hangover wears off. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 1/28/2015 Great coffee and even better people!  Best cold-brew iced coffee in town. Sometimes they even have homemade almond milk (which I've never seen anywhere else), which they use to make horchata. Try a half iced-coffee, half horchata if it's available. Incredibly good.  This is a genuine neighborhood coffee shop that I am very happy to have near me. Small, friendly, unpretentious, laid-back, and family-owned by native Austinites. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 8/5/2014 I spotted Corona Cafe last year while taking my kiddo to school. I decided to wheel in one day, and I'm glad I did. Wonderful coffee, and great people behind the bar. (And it seems like a magnet for intriguing customers.)  A few other folks have commented on Naiman's passion for top-quality coffee. It's so true -- I think he's a teacher at heart, and he's always happy to use his encyclopedic knowledge of coffee to field any questions I've had.  Always a pleasure to stop by CC and get my day off to a good start. ", pos

Corona Coffee ," 6/4/2014 6 check-ins Quiet, small, community-oriented place with landscapes and portraits by local artists on the walls. I'm munching on a turkey-basil sammy from ""the greencart"". It's delicious but too tiny to justify the $6.75 price. This would be an excellent place to write an essay undisturbed. The music is at waiting room volume. They honored my 10 percent yelp check-in discount. There are only five other humans here, including staff. Bizarre, metallic stars of the prom-decor variety hang from the ceiling, lending a ""we put whatever up""/ absolute lack of pretense/ deeply casual kinda feel, which I profoundly appreciate. They're playing bluegrass and talking about who's playing where tonight. Three stars because it's relatively expensive, cappuccino tastes a little burnt. ", neutral 
Corona Coffee ," 6/8/2012 This place is exactly what a friendly neighborhood cafe should be.  I drive far out of my way to visit this coffee shop, and the owners always make me feel so welcome when I do. The family who owns this shop are the nicest and coolest people I've ever met, their awesome kids work here too and make the best drinks!  Everytime I have been here I have tried something new and have never been disappointed. Everything from the home-made muffins to the home-made sandwiches are delicious!  -Try the orange-cranberry muffin -The tomato-basil sandwich. Can't go wrong with chicken salad either. -Their iced coffee is the best! I also love the iced chai, or ask them to make you an Italian soda! -They even get cupcakes from a local baker on occasion and they are delicious!  As for the shop itself, I can only say nice things. It's so cozy, the wifi is super-fast considering the place is always filled with people using their laptops, and it's very clean. They always play great music (never too loud though, so I can still work, but enjoy it)  Unlike the other reviews, I don't mind in the slightest that they are closed on the weekends, because not only do they sell weekend coffee-provisions (brilliant) but I understand that spending time with family is important, these people work very hard and deserve that.  This place is my new home away from home.  Corona Cafe-can't top that! ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 6/15/2012 This is a really cute little coffee shop in north Austin. As soon as you walk in you can tell it's lovingly run by the folks who own it, as it feels exactly as a coffee shop should: cozy, ""home made"" and with lots of interesting photos and artwork all over the place. The family that runs it was overly welcoming, chatting me up about this, that and the other and just making you feel like you're completely welcome to hang around. Seriously, they were some of the nicest people I have ever known. It feels like hanging out in your mom's kitchen.  Loved me some breakfast tacos (I hadn't been to Austin for awhile and forgot just how great those little wrapped up Mexican fingerfoods can be!) and the coffee was just perfect.  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in the city. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 4/24/2012 Updated review This place has improved tremendously since I was last here. The interior feels like you are inside someone's living room, which is very comforting.

Corona Coffee ," 3/15/2014 All-around positive vibes at this laid-back coffee shop w/ great food, juice and other options as well. Especially if you're staying in one of the depressing chain hotels near here, you owe it to yourself to spend your morning here. ", pos 
Corona Coffee ," 5/15/2012 I want to give this place five stars, but the fact that they're not open on weekends (or haven't been the last few times I've tried to go) and I work most of the week makes it difficult.  Coffee is from Texas Coffee Traders, and I love that. It's family owned, and even the high school? age kids know how to make a good latte.  Mom makes fresh 'box lunches' every day. So far I've had a fresh turkey sandwich with a small pile of yummy mixed nuts (no peanuts in sight), grapes and shortbread cookies dipped in dark chocolate, and homemade chicken salad sandwich (with apples!) with strawberries and crunchy Annie's grahams on the side. Perfect portions; I love that its not crappy kettle chips and a wobbly pickle thrown on the side.  Especially if you live in 78723, it's worth checking out. ", pos

Café Crème ," 12/4/2016 Wonderful. Do not be fooled by the business exterior, the interior of this coffee shop is warm and welcoming. Seating is nice but outlets are sparse so make sure you're fully charged if you plan on staying a while.  The coffee is very good, I got a caffe mocha and my friend got an iced coffee both were refreshing with minimal bitterness or acidity. The bagel breakfast sandwiches we got were delicious! We both got the ham, egg, cheese, and tomato sandwiches. Mine was on a rosemary bagel and his was on the Jalapeño cheddar. Both were delicious and filling.  They also have breakfast tacos and the option of having your sandwich on a croissant. For lunch they offer crepes. Along with some muffins and a few types of pastries they offer in the counter case.  All in all, definitely a new east Austin favorite. ", pos 
Café Crème ," 10/16/2016 1 check-in What a good find on the south side!  I'm never on the south side, so I'm sure I'm missing many great places. However, as I was driving down south to take my sister to the airport, we stopped off here to kill some time before her flight took off. We both ordered chai teas, and plugged in our laptops and enjoyed the ambiance for a while.  This place was super busy when we were there, despite having lots of tables/seating. The service was excellent, our drinks were great, and we enjoyed our time here.  Not that I'll ever be in the area again any time soon, but if I am, I'll gladly make another stop here! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 8/31/2016 I went in for brunch today to cafe creme . Ordered green tea matcha latte and the salmon crepe.  Was not expecting much from matcha latte but turns out it was delicious ! Would definitely recommend it. For the crepe, it was slightly Luke warm. Would have preferred it little hotter but tasted ok. It was quite filling.  There are lot of tables so good seating options. Didn't see many outlets though.  Would definitely come back again to try out some more of the items on their menu! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 11/20/2016 Ordered a 12oz coffee and a breakfast taco. Both reasonably priced and delicious. If you're considering the breakfast tacos, I wouldn't get more than 2 at a time, they're pretty big. Yoga cats! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 8/3/2016 When we found this place online we pictured something entirely different, not a bad thing by any means, but the logo and website don't really match the cafe itself. It's on the quirky side with funky music, strange art, and yoga cat table numbers.  The staff was incredibly friendly and offered suggestions while we tried to figure out what to order. Not because their menu is overwhelming... but because we're just very indecisive...  We opted for a dirty chai and a dirty green tea latte which led to me wishing I had ordered a bigger size because they were delicious. We also ordered a lox bagel and some sort of pesto/tomato/mozzarella/spinach thing. I really wanted a breakfast sandwich but this specific one was egg-free, so I had them put an egg on it. Don't do what I did. The sandwich was huge and had way too much going on. I ended up taking the egg off and enjoying it much more.  If we're in the neighborhood again I'd definitely stop in for another dirty green tea latte! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 6/8/2016 1 check-in Walked in not knowing what to expect. The atmosphere was a mix between India, Moby (the artist) and everything hipster with modern tables. The music was random it went from elevator style, club Ibiza to some acoustic song rambling on in a high pitched voice. The voice reminded me puberty changes for a boy making his journey into adulthood.  The coffee was fantastic. Sweet, dark and refreshing. The breakfast tacos where very filling and the two small cups of salsa was just enough for each taco. Coffee to kick start the late morning ", neutral 
Café Crème ," 8/24/2016 1 check-in Came here with friends on the weekend because they wanted to get some Crepes. It was actually pretty delicious. I was quite surprised. It's located in an office area or sorts. There is plenty of parking around the building. It's a walk up and order place and the food is brought out to the table. I got the Tuscany with chicken and my friends got the Saigon. It was very good though. The crepe was very filling. I felt that the Tuscany was folded much better and there was less empty space, whereas the Saigon had a lot of empty space with no filling. I enjoyed both and would come back for more though and recommend it to others as well! See all photos from Jennifer N. for Café Crème ", pos 
Café Crème , 7/3/2016 We got there at 8:04am. 4 minutes after they opened. The gentleman behind the counter was super nice and wasn't upset that we showed up right when they opened. I ordered a mocha frappe which was delicious and we ordered two crepes. We sat down and the coffee was brought to us promptly.  About 40 minutes had passed and no crepe. I went to check on them and the gentleman was surprised that we didn't receive them yet. Turns out the printer got disconnected... Not their fault.  The lady from the kitchen came out and apologized to us again and asked if we want anything else.. We asked if we could have a chocolate croissant. They brought us TWO chocolate croissants and fresh squeezed lemonade that we didn't even ask for. So kind of them!  Our crepes arrived shortly after that and was delicious.  I would recommend this place to everyone and be back. Food was good and the service was very good as well. :) Cool decor Yum See all photos from Saila I. for Café Crème , pos 
Café Crème ," 1/10/2016 1 check-in Love that there are plenty of seats and there's a lot of natural lighting inside. It's not super dark like at most coffeeshops I've been to.  Their iced caramel latte is OK....not near the best ones I've had. And it's pricier compared to other places. Size large ""for here"" is a standard Mason jar, and it's not worth the $5.14 I paid if we're talking just about size.  There are several menu items to choose from, not just pastries like at most coffeeshops. I think there's an outlet near or at every table and there's wifi (although it's not as fast as I would like it to be). I'd definitely come here to work remotely if I ever needed to. Iced caramel latte, nothing added or taken out, made wth three pumps of syrup and not enough for me.. ", pos

Café Crème ," 4/19/2016 4 check-ins I am so pleased any time my commute takes me past Café Crème. Their service is friendly and drinks are great. However, what really sets them apart are their crepes. Each time I try their salmon crepe I wonder why they aren't more common. I recommend giving them a try.  Their atmosphere is warm and friendly. The baristas are always welcoming and willing to chat if you're hanging around the counter. Like many local coffee shops, their walls feature local art - available to purchase if you like! This definitely adds to the local flavor.  If you are in the area, I recommend giving this coffee shop a shot. Pun intended. Don't forget your loyalty stamp card! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 10/12/2015 1 check-in This place is easy to miss if you are headed East on Oltorf. I ended up flipping a u-turn in the strip mall parking lot just past it in order to make my way over. Upon entering you are immediately greeted with local art, including cassette tape canvass portraits of Johnny Cash and Bob Marley. There is a bakery case filled with bagels, croissants, pastries, cookies and kolaches. The seating area is a combination of small tables with chairs, sofas and an oversized leather chair and ottoman that has seen better days but still looks pretty darned comfortable.  In addition to the bakery items, there offer breakfast tacos, oatmeal, hand made savory tarts, an assortment of sweet and savory crêpes, and salads. The service was friendly and fast. They provide you with a cat card on a stanchion (instead of a number) to put on your table and they bring the food and coffee to you.  I ordered an Americano with foam on top and the Versailles crêpe with Brie cheese, artichoke, mushroom, onion and spinach. And while I enjoyed my coffee and crêpe, I really loved my dining companion's crêpe madame more - which was a crêpe monsieur (smoked ham, swiss cheese, rosemary honey mustard) with an egg on top. Next time, I will order that for myself.  All in all, Café Crème provides a relaxing art-filled Austin ambiance w/ great coffee & delicious food. It's all about that foam Bakery case Forget taking a number, take a cat. See all photos from Darla A. for Café Crème ", pos

Café Crème ," 3/9/2016 1 check-in This is a good AM breakfast stop if you're working in South Austin - here's why:  1) Location: Near 35, this spot is perfect if you're traveling west on Oltorf before hopping on the highway to work.  The place is easy to miss - it's in a building that looks better suited for a dentist than a cafe.  Forget about making a left into this lot when heading east... there is a ton of oncoming traffic.  However, a plus for this location is it's easy parking.  2) Service: The service was on-point.  The staff were everything you'd expect from a small business.  Very efficient but also friendly.  3) Product: My coffee was delicious and my everything bagel with bacon and egg was good.  The bagel was a little dry, and the eggs could've had more seasoning.  I would recommend asking for a toasted and buttered bagel to improve the overall sandwich.  4) Work Space: There were two spaces with small tables.  There was also a conference space of sorts that could be reserved.  From the outside, it doesn't seem as big.  If I lived in this neighborhood, I would go all the time. Colorful assortment of baked goods Kambucha to go ", pos 
Café Crème ," 4/21/2016 Pretty good coffee shop!  Doesn't get a higher rating because of the atmosphere, vibe was just a little off.  The decor kind of puts me off, it feels a little too much like an elementary school classroom.  Breakfast crepe was basic but done well. ", neutral 
Café Crème ," 9/1/2016 1 check-in I had no idea this place existed until I took a shortcut on the way home and spotted it. I LOVE coffee shops, so I had to check it out. Their coffee is great. I drink mine black so a smooth, not burnt, coffee is always my hope and they did not disappoint. Also, they have breakfast tacos! And crepes! And it's all available until 3! Yay! I've never been to France, so I can't compare but I thought my crepe was very tasty. I'm excited to come back and try more. It's a little bit backwards in that they bring everything out to you without utensils or fixings and no one mentions where to find such items. (They're on a table by the front, that you've forgotten about by the time you order and sit down) But staff is very friendly and available guide you in the right direction.

I had the Nova Scotia crepe and, considering the pricing, I was shockingly surprised and satisfied.  I also order the cafe creme brulee and that also did not disappoint.  I don't know how they do it, but they managed to make the foam good lol.    There's plenty of seating here, but I wish they would place some plants around the tables to separate the tables from the parked cars.  Whenever I'm at Mozart's, I keep telling myself that I wished they had Cafe Creme's food/crepes/desserts.  Don't think that's going to happen though. ", pos 
Café Crème ," 11/2/2016 I don't know why anyone would rate this anything under five stars. This place is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin, with Fair Bean coming close second. The atmosphere is just so peaceful, and the baristas are by far the nicest people you will ever meet. Every time I come here, good quality coffee, crepes, kombucha on tap, and spectacular service, everything really is good here. Nothing pretentious or upscale about this coffee shop as opposed to all the other little places around town. If you're anything like me, appreciate good service and quality, go here before Starbucks. It's the same price if not cheaper and tastes 1000x better. Ps, the blonde barista with the blue eyes is the nicest one I have met so far, they are all nice!

Café Crème ," 2/15/2016 1 check-in Listed in 200 Review Self-Challenge, Coffee-holic One of the first days in Austin I wanted to check out a cafe/coffee house nearby to East Riverside - where I was staying. First off you should know that even though they have their own private parking lot not sure if there's a bike stand. I came via Uber and walked back to my Airbnb - note there are some sidewalks on roads and some without so pedestrian minded folks beware!! The decore is quint and colorful, a collection of nic-nacs surround the walls and bookshelf in the front room. The shop is quiet expansive and bathrooms are in the very back. There's plenty of seating between lounge chairs and couches to standard tables and chairs.  I ordered a Mediterranean/Tuscan crepe with a iced coffee. The crepe was warm and full of even parts tomato, cheese and meat. Tasted fine but nothing special. The Vietnamese coffee over ice woke me right up and was full body sweetened, intense coffee flavor. Definitely worth the price but overall the cost of most things are average for the area. Staff were nice and the atmosphere was comfy, soft music playing in the background. Overall nice place but nothing special. ", neutral

Café Crème ," 3/3/2016 1 check-in Came here with a friend who had visited (just earlier that week) and highly recommended this place. It was out of our way but heck, I'm always down for good coffee shops!  The baristas were friendly. The atmosphere was super chill and conducive to work, until 2 girls next to our table started chatting loudly about their lives, to which I'd rather not hear had I had that option.  My cappucino, however, was a Huge letdown.. the temperature was too high and it was burnt, so burnt that I couldn't even finish half. My friend's iced coffee, however, was pretty good.  This cafe also serves food, which means that if you stay there for long enough, you walk out smelling like food rather than coffee..  Alas, I'll probably give this place another try if a friend insists or if I live in the area, but not until then. ", neutral

I ordered the Nova Scotia because I love Lox and it reminded me of it and it did not disappoint. It was delicious and completely refreshing (especially for those hot summer days in Austin). On the other hand, the Saigon was the opposite in which it was an explosion of rich, savorful flavors. Still delicious.  The establishment gives off a studious college vibe. There are scattered tables perfect for diners/studiers of 1, 2, or a mild sized group. It was quiet when we went (around lunch time) with diners on their laptops, studying from their books, and sipping on their coffees. Besides crepes, the establishment also offers baked goods, which we have yet to try.  Warning: they stop serving crepes around a certain time (2 pm?). Check their website before you go if you are intent on some delicious crepes or otherwise you're setting yourself up for huge heartbreak. Nova Scotia (forefront) and Saigon crepes (back) ", pos 
Café Crème ," 9/15/2016 This is kind of mean but I hope this cafe doesn't ever get too popular - I Love the chill vibe, the lay out, the perfect size, the pastries and the Vietnamese coffee. I can really relax here, the music playlist is always so good and not generic, the baristas are straightforward and easygoing. I can always find a table and it's far away enough from campus to not be overloaded with students. I recommend the salted chocolate chip cookie and the Vietnamese coffee, but not at the same time :) sugar high for days! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 5/17/2015 2 check-ins Thoroughly enjoyed my visit yesterday. I ordered a dirty Chai and a bagel with egg and bacon on it. Dirty Chai was perfect -sweet, but not too sweet. Bagel was rosemary salt from Rockstar bagels, which is always a good choice. Bacon was cooked just the way I like it - crispy but not burned.  Atmosphere was nice. It's a small place, but they've done well with layout of tables and furniture. After eating,  we played chess. There are board games available on the shelves that you can play, and books too.  A few people were hanging out on their laptops and doing work, so you know the WiFi has to be pretty good. ", pos 
Café Crème ," 4/29/2016 I've visited Cafe Creme a handful of times, since I used to live nearby and now work close by. I love love LOVE their baked goods! Their iced black coffee is amazing and, as someone who is lactose-intolerant, this is a huge relief. The staff is usually super nice and friendly, and space is super nice and comfortable.  The only reason for a 4-star review is because of the ""hiccups"" I've hit when ordering something made hot/fresh. In the past, I put in an order for some breakfast sandwiches, only to be told that the chef wasn't yet in to do it. This was, admittedly, my fault since I pretty much came a few minutes after opening. I decided to give it another shot a few weeks later, and was disappointed by my egg and cheese breakfast croissant sandwich. The egg was burnt and the croissant was very stale. I'm not sure if I was just doubly-unlucky, but I'd like to think others would have a better experience with ordering cooked-to-order items from here.  Overall, Cafe Creme is worth the visit to grab some delicious pastries and fabulous coffee, but you may be taking a gamble on the cooked-to-order foods! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 7/31/2015 1 check-in This place is pretty unexpected as far as East (of I-35) Oltorf goes. It is a quaint little coffee shop, featuring a menu filled with fantastic flavors. I got the Snickers coffee drink (because it's Friday), and a white chocolate blonde brownie (because I'm an adult, and eat what I want). Both were fantastic.  The staff was helpful and courteous, and the atmosphere was quiet, with some people working on computers, and others socializing quietly, or reading books. They have a ""Leave a book, take a book"" book exchange library which is super Austin-y, and definitely something I look forward to taking advantage of with some old college textbooks I've been looking to put somewhere.  I'll certainly be back, and I'll bring enough money to buy them out of white chocolate blonde brownies. Don't forget to pick up a coffee drink stamp card for rewards! ", pos 
Café Crème ," 12/22/2015 We really are spoiled for choice when it comes to coffee places in austin. However, Cafe Creme stands out amongst the rest. While it perhaps isn't as ""hip"" as some other joints in Austin, their pastries are phenomenal (especially when they heat them up,) they pull great espresso shots using good coffee beans (I often find some of the artisan coffee beans that places in Austin use aren't that great because they're too oily or tangy tasting.)  The atmosphere is incredibly chill and relaxed. It's a great place to get a lot of work done with minimal distractions.    Having been to almost every coffee establishment in Austin, I can safely say that this is among the best. ", pos

Café Crème ," 11/20/2015 The coffee at Cafe Creme is tasty and fresh. Service is excellent and it's a big place with lots of room. That being said, the food is highly overpriced and mediocre. A croissant with egg and cheese will run you $7.50 (their menu says $6.50). It was completely smothered in greasy cheese. Nothing organic or local or fancy for that high dollar ticket. For two tacos, the sandwich and a couple coffees we spent $24. You can have a lovely sit down breakfast at other places in Austin for the same price as this place. This would be a good place to work as the dining room was almost empty, but I would skip the food. Half of a $7.50 croissant and a breakfast taco. Both were quite greasy and covered in cheese.

The best part about the staff is that they are open to criticism of the drinks and are actively working to make them better.  As far as the atmosphere goes, its very laid back with some background music so add to the ambience. The decoration primarily consists of artists' paintings on the walls which are for sale.

Café Crème ," 4/5/2014 13 check-ins Listed in Great Austin Coffee Houses The lowdown on this place is this:  the people who run it are bakers who own a catering business (they still do this) so this is why their cookies, pastries and kolaches are so great--they are baked in house fresh each day!  In addition to these homemade goodies they also sell other snacks like potato chips, chocolate covered raisins and pizza from East Side Pie.  They also serve bagels they get refrigerated in from Brooklyn, NY.  As for beverages:  their loose tea selection is pretty cool and they brew and sell Texas Coffee Traders coffee.

The kolaches were pretty tasty. Over all it is a great spot whether you want to just hang and enjoy some beverages or need to buckle down and get work down. Only wish it was open later.

Take a walk over to the corner of 6th and Congress- enter into the mezzanine at the Bank of America building on the corner- put the Starbucks to your back and enjoy a coffee by Sam. Make sure to provide an email address and earn your stars for that future cup. I guarantee you will be back. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 12/2/2016 Great little spot to get good coffee at low price..nice selection of coffee and tea.. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 10/4/2016 The reviews have been right. It is so hidden but such a good latte the Summermoon.  Definitely worth it,  it is hidden though past security (you can just walk past)  behind the elevator. Very friendly server! ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 9/7/2016 Friendly people, delicious coffee in a hole in the wall inside BofA building. The moon milk was a bit over the top for me but I can see that a touch of it can be a nice treat. That said the local Roaster ""Summer Moon"" makes an excellent, well-balanced medium roast that is now in my suitcase! Looking forward to the morning. Thanks and see you next time! ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 2/21/2016 Brian's is in the Bank of America building, past the elevators and on your left. I'm a tea drinker and they serve Mighty Leaf tea, which is my favorite brand! They were so super friendly here that I recommend visiting them based solely on that! ", pos

Brian’s Brew , 5/24/2016 just go. get the summermoon. still thinking about that latte. a little hard to find at first but just go past the elevators :) , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 5/18/2016 Nice guy!! If you are looking for summermoon's moon milk, then this is the place to go downtown. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 4/11/2016 Yes, yes, yes. The Wintermoon (iced summermoon) is the best latte I've ever had. I can't even-  I loved it so much that I seriously considered doubling back and getting another one in the same cup after I finished it (refill style). I've never felt that way about a coffee beverage before. I like that it's not like a big chain and it's in a very corporate-feeling building. It's kind of like a small act of resistance to shop local while surrounded by such huge businesses. Anyway- if I'm downtown, this is the place I'd want to go. Despite being a gold status Starbucks cardholder/addict?  Friendly but not in that overwhelmingly-perky way (which, let's be real, too much perk is tricky when I've had too little coffee on a Monday). I'd definitely come back and recommend to friends. I know one in particular who'd love a ""Cold slap in the face"". It's a drink, and definitely ask about it when you're there :) ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 5/17/2016 Not what you expect to find when you walk into the Bank of America building...worth the strange walk past the elevators though to find great coffee and super friendly service. Both the hot and iced coffees are great. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 3/24/2016 Had the best latte of my life! That Summermoon is amazing. I typically like coffee and enjoy a good latte, but I LOVED this drink. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 6/24/2015 Just a small takeaway coffee bar, but the wood fire roast they use is fantastically smooth. Standard preparations (drip, espresso). The barista was friendly and knowledgeable. Americano was delicious.  I'd go back any time, but not for the ambiance. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 10/26/2013 1 check-in Located in the Bank of America in Dowtown Austin, in the back if the lobby.  Brian not only owns the place, he is there making and serving your drinks.  Brian is really nice and even had suggestions where to eat.  There is something familiar about chains, that no matter where you are, you know what us in the menu.  But I'd rather patronize small independent coffee shops like this in trips (or even in my hometown) because it is a chance to meet local people and give back to the community.  If I am ever back in Austin, for whatever reason, I will definitely come back. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 8/29/2015 1 check-in Amazeballs!!! The wintermoon is the bomb!! They make their own cream and it honestly tastes like heaven. The service was awesome! It's kind of in a weird spot. Right outside of jimmy John's in the Bank of America building past the elevators. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 6/24/2015 I love to use Yelp when I visit other cities and I found this place as a result of trying to find a local coffee shop near my work office. Turns out, this was a great place!  The breakfast tacos were on point (seriously get the bacon, so good!) and I had a delicious vanilla-spicy chai (Or as chombo as my fave place in seattle calls it). Guy behind the counter had never heard of this, but now he knows it's totally a thing.  Definitely recommend, I wish I liked coffee more. I was super tempted to order the Summermoon but...blech, coffee is not a flavor i like. LoL ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 11/11/2013 1 check-in As other reviews state, Brian is there making the coffee. Super nice guy executing a great idea...fire roasted coffee.  I just got a cup of drip to go, since there is no seating. Good equipment plus good beans yields good coffee. Not amazing coffee, but good coffee.  Probably return again this week. Give it a try. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 11/13/2015 Lived up to the ratings. Great coffee and great service! The cream and coffee combo in the summer moon latte was the perfect pick-me-up. It is worth the trip to the hidden location. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 8/2/2012 1 check-in Listed in Keep Austin Weird Wood fire roasted coffee?  Yeah, you definitely caught my attention.  It took me a little while to find this spot.  Fortunately, when you enter the Bank of America building on Congress there are helpful signs that direct you past the elevators and then to make a left.  There, sits Brian's proudly serving all the ticky -tackies (and they all look just the same)  I grabbed a double espresso and while I was disappointed that there was no demitasse, the product itself did not disappoint.  It was a smooth shot, reminiscent of an Italian espresso.  I think I actually got to speak with Brian or maybe he has a worker who looks just like the guy in the illustration.  He told me about how they choose a medium roast for their espresso and they feel the wood fire roasting is what develops the smoothness of the shot.  Clearly, they are also pulling it properly because as any coffee snob knows, even the greatest beans can be destroyed by poor technique.  The people who work in that building are very lucky to have such a dedicated purveyor on their first floor.  Of the coffee that I drank in Austin, this was some of the best. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 8/22/2013 2 check-ins Brian is da man!  This small coffee dispensery is located inside the B of A building on Congress.  He(Brian) is an awesome guy to talk to and takes pride in his craft.  Their espresso beans are wood fire hand roasted locally and brew with an amazing crema layer....smooth.  I bring home a bag every visit to Austin.  I'm a fan of their half wintermoon which is Brian's concoction of milk with flavors.  It's between a white mocha and a latte so you still get the coffee flavor you deserve.  Good distribution of espresso between the three sizes.  12oz =1 shot, 16oz = 2 shots, 20oz = 3 shots. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 7/16/2012 Updated review Brian messaged me through Yelp explaining the situation of his reason for closing. I still have yet to try the coffee here, but Brian seems like a stand up guy about his business!  I would suggest checking his Website/Facebook for updated hours (not yelp's) ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 5/15/2012 1 check-in Girlfriend got the groupon here and so I tried the Mocha Moon Latte. I have to admit this place is definitely better than Starbucks. The Mocha flavor was strong and the cup was pretty sweet. Made perfectly that I didn't need to do anything else to it. Just the way I like it.  I didn't even notice that the logo was actually the guy behind the counter.. at least I hope it is. haha , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 8/19/2013 My Summermoon latte was quite good, flavorwise...though it is just short of cloyingly sweet.  It had an excellent dark/smoky flavor as an aftertaste, which was quite delightful and made me really wish I'd gotten just a straight-up latte because if that aftertaste came from the beans I need to go back and get myself a bag of them.  I'm definitely a fan of this place because I like good coffee, but microfoam is the second best part of a latte and I didn't notice any.  Before I ordered, I asked what the Summermoon tasted like, and was told something like ""pure deliciousness"" or ""pure awesomeness"".  It's a bit of a hard sell...how often do you buy something to eat when the person making it cannot tell you what it tastes like.  When he said it was the top seller, I decided to take the plunge.  Then it took a few minutes to mix up the milk in the back room, and I was told ""sorry, need to make more unicorn tears"" or somesuch.  Finally I got to taste it, and darn if I can't place the taste anyway...I can't describe it to you, so I'm not much surprised that he didn't describe it to me.  So it's not in the easiest location to get to, the drink has indescribable flavor, it took a while to make my drink, and I missed my foam, but that coffee tasted gooood...does the rest really matter so much? ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 11/16/2011 So I just strolled into work this morning, got everyone's full attention, and asked if I can sing praises from a mountaintop about how g damn great my morning coffee tastes.  I was walking by the BofA building, as I do every morning, and mused about how much I love the Brian's Brew sidewalk sign out, as I do every morning - only this time I decided it was time to duck in & give it a try.  HOLY HOLY HOLY YAY.    ONE TASTE YA'LL and I'm sold.  Forget the other couple of places down the way - they aight.  But Brian's Brew takes the cake.  Hands down.  It's the best.  Rich, nutty, bold, smokey - DANG. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 1/21/2012 Brian's Brew popped up on my radar recently, and I dropped by while running errands one morning. I had no idea it was tucked into a nook in the Bank of America Center. For those running around downtown, it is conveniently located in a busy area.  Who would not like a nice fire-roasted cup of Summermoon Coffee alongside some other baked goods--from Round Rock donuts, Rock Star, and Bakerman's? My coffee and 3 small breakfast staples ran me just $4.50.  For a locally owned coffee shop in a very corporate-driven building, check out BB. You will not be disappointed, and the guy really takes care of you here. Is his name Brian? Hopefully he can fight the good fight while charging so little for some quality selections. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 7/17/2013 This place is awesome! I've been going to Brian's Brew for about a year now and just sad that I no longer work downtown to get my summermoon latte! , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 11/3/2013 Damn fine espresso. Crema was a little weak but it was served in a big cup. But the flavor... oh the flavor! Wood fired roasted, need I say more. Try it. Sip it. Savor it. Love it. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 1/6/2012 It's the best coffee within walking distance of downtown offices, delivered swiftly by a polite staff.  It's not magical, but when something's the best at what it does, it should get five stars. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 7/16/2013 Had coffee from the self-self machine and wintermoon latte - both very good and above average coffee. Definitely will be coming back a lot. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 5/16/2013 I was going to get a Starbucks, but went to the ATM first... There, I saw the coffee shop sign and decided to get a latte there instead. Oh boy! That was the right decision. Brian was so nice and the Mocha Latte suuuper delicious... He told me it was the best mocha in town. He was right. ", pos 
Brian’s Brew , 12/19/2012 I love this hidden gem! The lattes here are amazing! Hot and cold. I come here as often as I can. It's nice to have a place that's not over-rated and commercialized like Starbucks. The Summermoon and Wintermoon lattes are to die for. , pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 12/5/2012 The mocha I had today was phenomenal. It's an office-based coffee service window, so don't expect a sit-down shop. Nonetheless, it is worth your time and effort. I didn't think that I would be able to distinguish the difference with the ""wood-fired"" roast. I was wrong. The mocha was the best ", pos 
Brian’s Brew ," 10/5/2011 Brian is the man.  He is congenial, polite, and skilled at his craft.  He is the kind of shop owner who remembers his regulars and the level of service is consistently rockstar.  The wood-fire coffee is rich, smoky, and roasted by an individual with an appreciation for the subtle complexity of coffee.  His prepared drinks are unique and delicious.  Try the summermoon latte and the espresso milkshake.  You can't go wrong with either.  Beyond the quality of his eponymous brew, Brian purveys the culinary highlights of Austin.  Round Rock Donuts, Torchy's Tacos, and Eastside Pies all in one place--no where else downtown can you find such variety.  Give Brian a shot, his shop is a hidden gem of what Austin is all about.

Brian’s Brew ," 1/24/2013 Yup. The reviews are spot on. This place lives up to the five star Yelp rating, fo' sho'. In need of some really good coffee, I walked over to this place to try it out. I wanted a Round Rock donut, too, I won't lie. Having those things a mere three blocks from my office is a dangerous thing...  I walked up and, other than a couple of guys who were just picking up their coffee to leave, there wasn't anyone in line. I ordered a 1/2 sweet Summermoon Latte and grabbed an oatmeal from the counter (totally forgot about the Round Rock donut... damn). The guy, who I assume was Brian, was friendly and worked quickly. The latte was delicious! So smooth, and even though it was the 1/2 sweet one, it was plenty sweet for me. I'm anxious to try the drip coffee, and I saw some coffee in mason jars... did I hear him say those were cold brewed? That might be good to take home to have on the weekends. Anyway, definitely try this place. You won't be disappointed. The building is caddie corner to Starbucks, so its not far out of the way if that's where you're headed. Plus, it kinda puts Starbucks to shame. ", pos

Legend Coffee ," 10/27/2016 1 check-in I really loved this place! Tucked right behind Franklin's, Legend Coffee Company is situated in a cozy trailer/truck house. When we were there, everything was ran by one person....I feel bad for not catching her name but she was a true magician, creating exceptional concoctions.  Even though it wasn't on the menu, I had heard wonderful things about The Queen Bee: espresso, honey, milk, and coconut oil. Never realized all of my favorite things could go together! Talk about a drink with multiple layers of flavor: slightly sweet, creamy, and a tad savory. Like woaaaaaaaa!  Quality coffee, amazing customer service, talented baristas...this is THE place to check out! I promise that you won't be disappointed and you are in for a treat! Specials listed The Queen Bee - espresso, milk, honey, and coconut oil ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 10/9/2016 1 check-in If you are the kind of person who will get to Franklin Barbecue hours early, this little coffee stand will be a blessing to you.  It is very conveniently located behind this famous eating spot.  And even if you're not around for meat, the coffee is worth stopping all on it's own.  The deluxe mocha is lightly sweet almost like a hot chocolate which I personally liked.  The Cassandra (a honey cinnamon latte) is actually surprisingly nutty which I also enjoyed.  Also it helps that the people running the place are really nice. ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 2/26/2016 1 check-in I can't get enough of all the food trucks in Austin. Each one has such personality - some are air streamers, some are buses, some look like little houses on wheels. The only thing they have in common is that they are on wheels and that they are uniquely decorated to the whim of the owner of the truck. I love that.  Legend Coffee, is no exception. Parked behind Franklin BBQ on an unpaved yard, is this tiny little house on wheels. It's made entirely of wooden slats, complete with a 3 tiered roof, and a tiny cut out window where the barista works gracefully as if this were her own home.  The people in Austin do not rush you. They let you take your time, examine all the different types of beverages they offer, before gently nudging you to order. There probably isn't a huge line in front of you and probably not a huge line behind you. And, if there is, people are quite chilled out about it. I think that affects how a beverage is made. Because the cortado that I ordered was one of the most delicious coffee drinks I've ever had.  The Queen Bee Cortado piqued my interest, an espresso with steamed milk, honey, and coconut oil. I've never had coconut oil in my coffee before, but let me tell you, it was delicious. It smelled better than any coffee I've ever had. Coffee with honey and milk you can probably imagine, but the full bodied finish of coconut oil in the end, that just give it a third texture, smell, and dimension that I didn't expect but ended up savoring. I highly recommend it and wish I had a cup right now. today's specials Legend Coffee's adorable food truck house longhorn ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 7/3/2016 If I'm being honest, I would have to admit that I'm not a big coffee drinker...and when I do drink it it's typically Starbucks. Today, I though I decided to try something new and check out this coffee shop while waiting in line for some BBQ. I quite happy I did! My mocha deluxe was pretty awesome. It was made with sea salt and cinnamon but not too much. This has definitely made the wait for Franklin's much more bearable. The menu Mocha deluxe so good! ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 12/2/2015 Love Legend coffee! It is delicious, fresh, and hand crafted. It is clear the team takes pride and joy in what they do. I really feel cared for and listened to when I go!

Legend coffee and the green belt= perfect Sunday ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 2/27/2016 1 check-in Wow. I am so happy to have found this place (waiting for Franklins) i'm glad that I live just up the street.

Queen Bee Cortado ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 3/7/2015 1 check-in Let's keep this short and sweet: these guys know coffee.  They are poised right behind Franklin's BBQ and serve some amazing tasting and really inexpensive coffee. They have fancy things like a cayenne cinnamon hot chocolate, different daily baked goods and bags of coffee beans, but the regular hand poured coffee was spectacular!  They use an Ethiopian roast that smells intoxicating, especially in the cold. Have it black, or visit the table a few steps away for cream and syrup (in a bourbon bottle, I like their style).  All in all, super highly recommended. I wish they were down in Miami, I'd drink this everyday! ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 5/23/2016 I've walked my dogs past this place forever but always forget to bring $ with me--so glad I finally did. I'm not real big on hot coffee so I got their City Slicker--cold brew with vanilla and cream--and it was great! I'm now a repeat customer. Also got a scone once before the pastries ran out, and I look forward to more of those as well. Not too sweet either, which I like. I think they get a lot of business from the line at Franklin's, but it would be a great place to stop on your way to work, as there are places to park and you can dash in and out (but they don't open till 8am). ", pos 
Legend Coffee ," 2/9/2016 1 check-in Legend Coffee is convenient because it is right next to Franklin BBQ. It's actually a food truck not a coffee shop. Their coffee is subtle, not too sweet. I tried their Mucho Mint Mocha and their Cassandra. Both of them were warm drinks. Both of them were not too sweet and subtle. So if you like your drinks sweet, I would add some extra sugar. The Cassandra is a honey, cinnamon latte which was nice. They only have one size and they were about $5 each. They run out of food pretty quickly since a lot of people get to Franklin BBQ really early so if you're planning on grabbing a quick bite, I would stop by somewhere else on the way or walk to some nearby food trucks or coffee shops.

As I was already bouncing uncontrollably from the frigid temps, I swapped my usual morning latte for the Chai.  The spicy sweetness warmed me up and lifted my spirits to carry me through to the final destination of the Franklin cashier.    Even though we brought mimosas for our midday beverages, the ideal choice would have been to bring a bottle of bourbon to top off the available supply of warm milky beverages from Legend Coffee Co.  Next time! ", pos

Both delicious on the own, but the Cassandra is a cinnamon/honey flavor latte. I've never had that combination before in a coffee and was quite surprised how delicious it is.

Legend Coffee ," 1/23/2015 1 check-in waiting in line for Franklin BBQ in 35 degree weather isnt very fun, but when the kind folks at Franklin mentioned that Legend Coffee was open for business in the Franklin BBQ parking lot, i was all about getting a nice, hot drink haha. they have a good spot for anyone waiting in line for BBQ, but other than that it is hard to spot their trailer so hopefully the line foot traffic and word of mouth  is enough to keep them in business b/c their coffee is good!! i'm a sucker for a good pour over cup of coffee so that's exactly what i ordered. at $3, i thought it was really affordable too. Heck at starbucks their coffee is already $2 a cup so i'll pay that extra money for a freshly brewed cup haha. its pretty cool how they have an entire coffee shop set-up in a trailer - they have all the fancy equipment to make you a mocha, espresso, or latte if thats your drink of choice too. huge selection of tea for the non-coffee drinkers out there and they do offer a small selection of pastries if you need a snack while you wait. the service was super friendly as well. i hope that Legend Coffee does well!

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 10/21/2016 This place looks very unassuming on the outside but its a very nice, quaint transport to a world of awesomeness. It's definitely a place I can see an Austinite sitting down on any given day to work at a cafe.  The owners are really nice charming people, knowledgeable and passionate about their gelato, knowing how to appeal to the italian roots they're proud of in their gelato as well as tastes for the american palate.  That said, EVERYTHING I tried was off the charts amazing in flavor. Smooth, velvety gelato that's not too sweet, with fresh cream and fruit flavor (for the fruity ones). I think particularly noteworthy are the cannoli and stracciatella - the stracciatella as an all around favorite for our group and the cannoli has bold vibrant flavor. I personally liked the cherry as well - tasted sweet, like fresh picked fruit. Cream cake is also good if you're into that kinda thing. And though the cheesecake looks very fruity and you'd imagine denseness, its very light and comes off the palate with a very clean cheesecake flavor (the fruit compote type jam on top helps cut the richness I guess).  All in all, you can get a cup of happiness for not that much more than any other ice cream shop in town and you clearly can't go wrong, so come on by. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 11/19/2016 Mmmm the gelato is so tasty! I came here for a dessert date and had the Tequila flavor with lime and blackberries. It was very fresh and had a teeny tiny taste of tequila in it. I would love to come back and try some of the other flavors and baked goods.  The inside was very clean and stylish. Only downside was a small parking lot and lacking in outdoor seating. Also, it'd be nice to have more variety in coffee. Other than that I like this cute cafe! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 10/19/2016 If you're looking for a relaxing European coffee shop experience in the midst of a an increasingly boxy South Lamar--here is your oasis! This gorgeous little Italian cafe and gelato shop.  Operated by a delightful couple of folks (the gentleman can whistle like a Disney bluebird!), this place has coffee that tastes like you're on vacation and treats that are flaky and scrumptious. The ambiance is as balanced and sweet as the gelato. This place will chill you out and improve your afternoon. It's worth a little splurge for a Perfect 10 cafe! Cheesecake gelato and also a Coffee-type that was seriously so insanely DELICIOUSAAAAAA. Treats and Gelato ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/31/2016 1 check-in Cute little shop run by a gorgeoussssss couple. I mainly came here to try their gelato donut on a stick aka the Mr. Ring! They ran out of the chocolate ones when I arrived with my family, so I was disappointed about that and the woman told me there was only one white chocolate left and the rest were either cotton candy or lime, which I dislike both flavors so I chose the white chocolate.  The Mr. Ring is not made with an actual donut. I've been wondering what was inside and how it tastes, but mine was filled with vanilla gelato on the interior with a hardened white chocolate exterior. This is great for Instagram photos and for the experience, but the taste of it was only decent. The gelato filling is kind of melted and frothy, which is understandable because it's more challenging to freeze the inside effectively. If anything, I would only repurchase this to try out the chocolate flavor. Otherwise, I'd stick to their regular gelato selections.  My mom and older brother both got gelato cups and every single flavor I tried was absolutely delicious! My all time love of my life here would be their Venezia, which is the very liquid, smooth and creamy, dark and rich chocolate fudge. It is sooooo goooood. Another winning option would be their cheesecake! Yumz. And my mom adored the peach gelato. Cappuccino is delish too. Just get everything. ;)  Service was super polite and sweet. The parking lot is really tiny and it's on a hella busy street. We got lucky there was one parking spot left, but good luck to those of you on the struggle bus! Don't give up! Or at least give up and come back later LOL. I really like it here. Next time, I'm having my eyes set on their coffee and more gelato cups. Display case. Beautiful gelato flavors! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in I don't know. There seems to be another gelato place here in south Austin popping up with a few more. I'm pretty sure we will see a season of Gelato Wars on TV or in the newspaper. I have to admit though I don't know what is good gelato or bad gelato. As long as it doesn't make me sick, I'm fine with it.  I see photos on yelp for gelato shaped like donuts. Immediately I must go and check them out. Luckily they had a banner which said GELATO out in front otherwise I would have been wandering up and down Lamar looking for this place. The parking lot is small and space is very limited. Once you get inside, it's a cute, modern cafe with one case full of the gelato donuts, cake and tiramisu. There's another case full of the gelato. You can ask for a sampling of the gelato and I had the cookies and cream with cappuccino. As a result, it was pretty good gelato. Strachelli and cappucino Tiramisu and donut shaped gelato ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 12/3/2016 Great Gelato and friendly service. Dangerous that this place is almost within walking distance. My GF got the stracciatella and said it was just like the kind she used to get when living in Rome (she hasn't been able to find any like it since getting back to Texas). The gentleman that served us also mentioned that they will soon have fresh house made cannoli which are one or my guilty dessert pleasures, so we will definitely be back very soon. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/13/2016 1 check-in Venezia Italian Gelato is run by an Italian couple. I had a moment to converse with the owner (the kind lady) and she was so sweet. She works practically all day--wakes up bright and early to make the gelato and service her customers.  I got the 2 scoops of gelato for $4, which isn't bad. I had the hazelnut and peach gelato. The peach was very peachy (duh, right?)--it didn't taste artificial or bland. It has a hint of sourness, but a great flavor for a hot summer day.  They only allow you to try 2 samples and ask that you keep your spoons for environment's sake, which I fully appreciate. Overall, I'll give this place 3 stars + 1 star for the lady's service. The decor was nice, definitely a great study spot. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/26/2016 1 check-in Ahhh gelato. Takes me back to summers in Germany, and traveling the canals of Venice. There is something so delicate about the flavors, compared to ice cream.  Venezia Gelato does not disappoint when it comes to bringing that delicacy from Europe. A small with 2 flavor choices is about $4.50, with a medium being 3 choices for .50 cents more. Quite the steal compared to other speciality ice cream in Austin.  However, I'm floored at the interior of the shop. Ultra modern, with everything in black and white. Large windows face Lamar, and Mom's Tattoos. It's very clean, and neat, with some relaxing music playing in the background.  Obviously a family affair, they greet more family who shows up in support. Out of the 3 flavors I tried, cappachino, pecan and hazelnut... The hazelnut was my favorite. Will be back to try new combos! My ice! Beautifully displayed Lovely selections ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 11/13/2016 Ice cream donuts? Yes, it is true! They make donut shaped Gelato goodness and I am not sure what the outer coating is but I think just cream/sugar/yogurt and the inside is filled with gelato. We visited here the other night and my husband ordered THREE - he just could not stop eating them. I had a couple samples and ordered the vanilla and chocolate, so original I know, but they were good. I am used to the type of gelato that is more icy and not so creamy, but this is still good. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/2/2016 1 check-in I have definitely been on a gelato craze, so I was happy to discover a new spot sort of close to home! The parking lot is kind of small / hard to navigate through, so it would be best to try to go during non-peak hours or after the business next door is closed for the day! (they have about 3 or so spots reserved for that business).  The decor is absolutely beautiful! I loved the black and white theme, if I hadn't decided to stop using snapchat, I would have been snapchatting very inch of this shop. Even the gelato was beautiful! But let's move on to the flavors...  I ended up ordering a small with mint & apple cinnamon. The flavor choices I picked were probably not the best combination wise, but they were both so good, I couldn't resist. My partner ordered a small with cherry & passionfruit. I thought the coffee flavor was great, but I was so insistent on the apple cinnamon, I chose to forgo that since THAT flavor combination would've been even more weird! Overall, I thought each flavor I sampled was great, it was a matter of which flavor I wanted. The biggest thing I noticed about the gelato was how light/icey it was. I've seen to grown to like more creamy textures, so I was a little sad when it wasn't as creamy. However, I would come back & recommend others to check it out! Small mint & apple cinnamon, small cherry & passionfruit ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/30/2016 Came with my friend 10 days after they opened.  First impressions: lots of seating, very beautiful decor.  Their gelato was pretty good. 4/5 stars because comparatively to other places in Austin, I wasn't blown away.  Their mint gelato was REALLY good, however. Exceptionally.  Because of their ample space, would be great for large groups of friends to hang and enjoy some gelato. Good selection ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/15/2016 1 check-in My friends LOOOOOOVE this place. They come here once a week.  I thought it was very good & the owner looked very nice.  Cherry cheesecake was good-- looked amazing with graham crust crumbles on top. I thought it could use a little more cream cheese but that's just me. Passion fruit was really good-- tart & rich. The hazelnut chocolate is suuuuuuper rich and delicious but maybe too rich for most people.  This is a good, safe place to get gelato. They have flavors that are very typical for most Americans (""donuts"" ""vanilla"" ""coffee"" ""mint"" ""chocolate coconut"" and have a few exotic flavors ""passion fruit"" ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/30/2016 There is a lot of hoopla about gelato places in Austin and I just haven't seen what all of the fuss is about. Most of them don't offer what I consider real gelato. Venezia is in a league far above the rest.  Nicola and Alice are not only awesome people (Nicola in particular also has a great handshake), but they're slinging some awesome gelato too and the clear best in Austin in my opinion. It's even as good as what I've had in Venice, Italy where they hail from. They have genuine passion for what their creating here that you can easily tell and taste.  I first came over a month ago and last came a week ago and see they are getting busier and busier which I love. I plan on coming much more. I'm a big fan of their espresso too. There is now real gelato in Austin to enjoy! Ben fatto!! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 9/27/2016 Simply awesome. This is the place for gelato. When I was in Austin I was a regular here. Neat and clean decor, very nice people and the mix 2,3 scoops options are really good. All gelatos are made from scratch and u can feel the freshness in the flavor. We had capuchhinos as well. Everything is just perfect. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 11/20/2016 1 check-in Omg this place is so awesome and the gelato is DELISH!!! I have a dairy and gluten allergy and had me covered! The gelatin was definitely the BEST in town. Super fluffy and smooth! I Highly Recommend this place! The owner is from Italy too! He knows his stuff. From Italian to Italian this is the BEST place for gelato in Austin! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/7/2016 Ooh talk about authenticity! The Italian couple who opened this moved from their home about a year or so ago. Love the store layout and the gelato (please do not call it icecream) is so pleasing to the eye! They also have vegan flavors. Got the dark chocolate along with raspberry - both were vegan (I'm not vegan but it works in my favour since I'm mildly lactose intolerant) but man oh man, you cannot tell it apart from dairy ones. This has to be THE best dark chocolate gelato (or uh, ice cream) I've ever had in the world.  Owner and the employee are very friendly and nice to talk to as well. Going to keep coming back for it! What a yummy display. Sadly we didn't have tummy space for this. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/22/2016 After a lousy day, I wanted to bring my wife here as a little treat.  I'd read the great reviews and was hopeful they'd have some great gelato, and we weren't disappointed.   We tried a few samples of flavors including cheesecake and passionfruit and everything was tasty.   In the end we both went with pistachio and cherry which was made with a tart Italian cherry and was absolutely delicious.  The pistachio was nicely rich and nutty with real pistachios and not the fake green dyed atrocity you find at a lot of places.  I got a macchiato to go along with the gelatos and it was rich, roasty, and really went well with the gelato.  The owners were both very friendly and I wish them lots of success here.  We at least will definitely be back! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/6/2016 1 check-in Listed in 100 in 2016 It's such a pleasure stumbling upon delightful little local places! Venezia was one of those stumbles.  Decent parking for it's S. Lamar location and spectacularly clean on the inside, I had high hopes from the moment I walked in. The woman at the front greeted me with a huge smile immediately and made me feel welcomed and wanted. She patiently waited as I decided what to order. Great customer service! Venezia serves up various flavors of handmade gelato and coffee. I stuck with the Gelato this time around, but would love to try their coffee too.  A small gelato gets you two decent sized scoops for  $4. The best part is that you can choose two different flavors, even with a small order. I ordered the cheesecake flavor and the chocolate biscuit flavor. Both were amazing! The gelato was perfectly creamy and each flavor was strong and distinct. I also tried the pistachio and the mint chocolate chip which were equally amazing.  I recommend coming here for a tasty pick-me-up. You won't be disappointed by the exceptional customer service or the amazing gelato! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/14/2016 1 check-in Yummy yummy Gelato!!!!!  We drive through S. Lamar quite a bit and every time we pass this place I always say ""I want to go there."" Well we finally got the chance to and our experience was amazing!  We both have had gelato before. L.C. had it in Italy and myself in Hawaii (lol lame, I know). But the owner of the place is so so so sweet, and so welcoming. Educating us about gelato, the flavors, and how he makes them daily. We love to see people passionate about their businesses. Especially L.C. he loves conversation!  A tip: you can taste 2 different flavors at one time to see if they combine well! We got a kick out of that.  The sizes are small (2), medium (3), large (4), and they refer to how many scoops you desire. We both got mediums. They are open late too so perfect for after dinner! The flavors we liked were chocolate coconut, pistachio, cappuccino, black biscuit (Oreo), hazelnut, & mint. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/9/2016 nice sweet treat. a little pricey 4 dollars for 2 scoop of ice-cream on the cone, but they are organic ice-cream, clean and no chemical which is a plus..  I love hazelnut favor. yum.... ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/10/2016 My friends told me this was _the best_ and they weren't lying! This is my new favorite dairy treat spot in the entire city.  Venezia is a welcome addition. I'm a sugar snob, and I take my ice cream products seriously. I've had gelato everywhere from Rome to Richardson, and this is by far the best. Creamy and delicate, every bite was amazing. The flavors were the typical gelato flavors (hazelnut, pistachio,) with some extras thrown in (cookies and cream, strawberry cheesecake) and three vegan flavors for about 12 to 15 flavors to choose from.  I couldn't decide and had strawberry cheesecake and cherry. Both were rich and tasted so FRESH. It was like they had made it right in front of me (they didn't, but you could have fooled me). The service was super-friendly as well.  I highly recommend this place; just be sure to leave me a parking spot. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 6/29/2016 1 check-in I have been DROOLING over the photos of the Mr. Ring for a few days now. I FINALLY got to try their gelato and Mr. Ring...  OH. MY. GOSH. It was delicious. I finished my Mr. Ring before I even left the parking lot! I love gelato and I love chocolate covered anything...so this is the perfect marriage of my 2 favorite things.  I sampled some of their gelatos and they were so delicious! The pineapple gelato is dairy free and tastes like I'm eating a pineapple! YAS.  What's even more awesome about this place is that their gelato is non-GMO and artificial color free! WOO HOO. I'm a total convert. I'll be walking over here so I can eat one Mr. Ring there and eat one on my walk home. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 12/4/2016 Awesome addition to the growing South Lamar food scene and a great dessert or decadent snack option. Authentic gelato with creative and sophisticated flavors with the added bonus of luscious Italian pastries and exquisite coffee.  Even a modest selection of gourmet sandwiches.

Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/4/2016 Updated review Wonderful experience of incredible gelato. Clean environment with plenty of seating and amazing selection of flavors and combinations.

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/20/2016 I'm joining the chorus to say that Venezia is fantastic! Everything about my pop-in for a gelato on a sweltering summer afternoon felt authentically Italian. The proprietor is friendly and proud of his offerings, the flavors are familiar and yet somehow elevated, and the store is modern, spotlessly clean, and surprisingly large.  I went for a traditional pistachio and hazelnut for my first visit while my friend opted for two fruit flavors. All were so delicious that we were plotting our return trip before we left the store.  I want to tell everyone about Venezia because it may be a little less showy than some of its counterparts around town, but it is damn fine gelato. The real deal. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/27/2016 Love love loveeee this place!! I'm glad I found this new hole in the wall. It's easy to miss this place and turning into it is kind of hard -- but I assure ya it's worth it. I've tried other flavored but I ALWAYS get black cherry and passion fruit. You get two scoops for a small size so you can pick 2 flavors , pos

The owners are brand new here; they came here straight from Italy so you know this is the real deal.  Compared to the other gelato places in Austin, this place's flavors are lighter but still taste very desserty.  The consistency is more like ice cream -- but healthier I guess? Right?  You must come here nowwwwww. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/19/2016 1 check-in I've been trying to decide whether or not I should keep this place a secret. But I want them to do well and figured, I shouldn't be selfish. So here I am writing a review for the best gelato I have ever had.  Venezia is located off of South Lamar, right next to a tattoo shop, and if you blink, you might miss it. It doesn't have flashing lights waving you down saying ""THE BEST GELATO HERE"" but it does have the Italian flag, which pretty much says they're legit, no?  Upon walking in, we were greeted straight away with warm smiles. The owners are so sweet and friendly, and that made my whole experience that much better. The wife took care of us, allowing us to sample whatever we pleased. I tried the Passion Fruit, to which she made sure I understood to try the whole sample at a time, so that all 3 layers of flavors would mix together. And boy was she right. As soon as I took the entire sample, my eyes grew bigger and she could see that I was amazed! It was so delicious, words can't even begin to describe it.  My boyfriend and I ended up getting the Hazelnut and Passion fruit gelato. No regrets there.  The decor inside is cute and simple and if I could, I would live here. When we left, the owners said their thank yous and I quote, ""ciao"", still with smiles on their faces. It was 10 minutes before their closing time, and they still had a positive attitude.  From the moment we stepped foot into the place to the moment we stepped out, they were welcoming and I can't rave enough about the service here. The gelato was fantastic but the experience was even better.  I want this place to stay open for a while and possibly for forever. I want this husband and wife duo to succeed, so go. Go out and support this business, because I have never felt so much love for and from a place before. Passion fruit on top and hazelnut at the bottom ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 8/27/2016 Amazingly perfect! The inside ambience and the people makes it a must visit place. I read the online review and went there to get Mr.Ring! The owners gave me a warm welcome and they offered to decorate the Ring for the occasion.  Service was one of the best. The owner also offered me few flavors of Gelato to try (even though he knows i was not there to buy gelato). The flavoring was top notch.  Will be definitely back to try their coffee range and buy more Mr.Rings and gelato! Best place to hangout. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/30/2016 1 check-in I absolutely fell IN LOVE with the Ferrero Rocher gelato. I had it served with one scoop of the coffee flavor in a medium cup, where I quickly ate up the coffee just so I can savor the Ferrero Rocher. It was total bliss and I was immediately saddened that I didn't go up one size.  The amiable Italian owner added an even sweeter impression to our first visit. We asked him about the Tiramisu and even though my boyfriend didn't understand his accent, he was sold by the man's passionate description and tried it out.  I didn't even bother to try the Tiramisu, nor the Mr. Ring's (gelato donuts) which I originally went in for, after sampling the gelato. I'm now on a mission to find a gelato place in Houston that tastes as good, if not, I'll be coming back real soon! ", pos

It wasn't that difficult to find their business, but the parking lot is small.  They allow two sample for free before making your selection.  My son chose a small with two flavors, my husband had a waffle cone, and I chose a medium because I wanted three flavors.  I had the passion fruit, mango, and cappuccino.  I think the passion fruit was my favorite because it had a thin layer of chocolate and was the perfect combination.  We all enjoyed our treats and will definitely return next time we have a craving for gelato. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/30/2016 1 check-in I had a small sized gelato, half cherry and half pistachio.  Gelato was nice and smooth. Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the cheesecake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the gelato is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather pay $4 for a delicious gelato here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 7/17/2016 1 check-in The real deal traditional Italian gelato in Austin. Not sure what to write other than go here for the real deal.

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/23/2016 Not to toot my own horn but I'm sort of an amateur gelato aficionado of sorts. I sometimes pull an all out Ratatouille and spit out freezer burned ""gelato"" out of my mouth in Austin because let's face it, most of the gelato here in our great city is not legit.  Enter Venezia Gelato. This great couple has been in Austin for a year straight from Venice and they serve up the most authentic gelato on this side of the Atlantic. I seriously haven't had better gelato in Seattle, LA, or Vancouver BC. So I am extremely happy we have a great spot here in Austin now.  My favorite surprise was the chocolate which was almost a frozen high quality cake frosting (the only way I know how to describe it which doesn't do it justice) which paired extremely well with my cookies and cream. Not to mention Italian true espresso to complement the ice cream and close out the day. The decor was modern and quaint and this would be the perfect spot to bring a date for lunch or after dinner. Bravo! ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/10/2016 ""I'd have to get a second job if this were closer to our house,"" said my husband after our first visit here. Every flavor more delicious than the next. Super authentic gelato. I'd say this has claimed the title of best frozen dessert in austin. ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 9/8/2016 Mm they had a hazelnut nutella type gelato in summer. Coffee gelato is good. It's right next door to the tattoo shop. (I missed it driving past last time) They have delicious gelato & the man & woman who own the place are from Italy & so nice & welcoming & always having good conversation with the customers. A perfect gelato business we're lucky to have in Austin! , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/5/2016 BEST GELATO EVER!!!! I spent a summer in Sicily and tried a few other places in Austin that I like, but this place is hands down the best dessert you will ever eat! The owners are an adorably sweet couple and the actually remembered me and my friend a month later at our 2nd visit! It's kind of tucked away on Lamar and hard to see so I hope the word gets out. They let you try any flavor, but it's so hard to choose! Seriously you have to stop by ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/18/2016 After sampling several gelato places across the country, Venezia is by far #1 on my list.  The favors and variety cannot be matched!!  The authenticity of true Italians cannot be matched, each time I've been in, and it's been several...the owners have always been so nice and treating everyone as if they are long lost friends.    The decor is kept clean and simple with a black and white theme.  If you haven't been... You must go; and go now!!  Enjoy!! I'll see you there ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/1/2016 Best gelato in ATX (and believe me, I've tried the all). The only bad thing is that all of the flavors are amazing and it's impossible to decide which one to get. I ultimately got the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. The nutty flavors in the pistachio and hazelnut are incredible. And the cherry is not too sweet and made with luxardo cherrys, giving it a ton of delicious depth. Only other place I've had gelato this good is Italy! Best gelato in ATX! My favorite flavors are the pistachio, hazelnut, and cherry. But you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/1/2016 1 check-in I noticed this new bright light beacon in the night as I was driving through my hood down Lamar. And was pumped when I noticed it said Gelato. YES YES YES! So I tired it out last night. When we walked in, I was in love with the decor, the open air of the place, and the super friendly owners and their family that was there. They said they just opened and seemed so excited to show us their products. I've NEVER seen Gelato like this. I think that means all the other ""gelato"" places in Austin, most likely aren't the real deal. My gf and I tried pretty much all the flavors. They were amazing. I don't know how I picked just two! I can't wait to go back and see more new flavors each week. This is great, so close to my house, and so yummy! A WIN FOR '04!!!! ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/8/2016 Hands down, the best gelato I've ever had. In fact, I'm not sure I can even say I've had proper gelato after having had theirs.  There's so much flavor packed into each scoop and their flavors are phenomenal. My personal favorites are the chocolate hazelnut (imagine Nutella but 1000% better) and passion fruit.  The owners are so friendly and kind which only adds to it all.   My Italian friend says this is as close as it gets to what you find in Italy and I'll believe her.  Plenty of parking and places to sit and enjoy this little gem of a place. It's quiet now because they just opened but it's not going to be long before they're packed out. ", pos

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 5/26/2016 Came here one evening as I was in the mood for a late night treat. The owners were super friendly and their gelato did not disappoint!  I tried a couple of different flavors (the Venezia was amazing!) and all were incredibly rich, smooth, and delicious. I ultimately got a cherry, pomegranate, and passion fruit combination which was to die for. The fruit flavors all came together perfectly.  I definitely recommend checking it out if you're in the area and looking for a tasty treat!! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato , 8/16/2016 This place is a must if you want authentic Gelato!! Try the cherry gelato. The gentleman helping us explained that the cherries are shipped from Italy. I have never had cherries that delicious. And they combine it with the gelato! Winning!! I can't wait until our next trip. , pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 7/12/2016 This place deserves nothing short of 5 stars. I ordered a medium (3 flavors) with passion fruit, hazelnut and Texas pecan. These guys know what they are doing! I couldn't resist the temptation and ordered two more scoops of straciatella and the Venezia. Venezia is the best flavor I have tasted in gelato. It tastes a lot like the inside of a ferrerro rocher. This is now my weekly dessert spot! ", pos 
Venezia Italian Gelato ," 8/21/2016 Amazing, amazing, amazing. Beyond the delicious and authentic gelato, the owners of this establishment are beautifully educated immigrants from Italy who completely embody the American Spirit.

It totally took me back to my favorite gelato shop in Rome, and it even has colorful gelato on a stick for all the kids and kids at heart!

My favorite flavors are the Venezia and hazelnut, but you can absolutely taste the quality of fresh ingredients and care that the owners put into all of their gelato. The gelato itself is so rich, creamy, with flavors that really stand out.  I actually met the owner when I went in the shop today and he is genuinely kind which helped make this my new favorite gelato spot here in Austin. Venezia can promise an authentically made gelato because the owners are actually from Italy and have a really cool family history of being in this business so you can be sure they'll do things right.

Venezia Italian Gelato ," 6/6/2016 In short, it's the real deal.  The creamy gelattos are incredibly rich and have great texture.  The fruit gelattos aren't oversweet, and have strong natural flavors.  The dark chocolate was perfect, and the hazelnut was just as strong.  They also have a number of vegan options.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/4/2016 Sister Epoch! I really like the coffee here, I like the coffee at the OG Epoch...all the same. The staff is great here. There are plenty of seats and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seats aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.  It's a solid choice for knowing it's not going to be packed, it WILL be quiet, you will get great service, and you WILL get work done. :) ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 12/4/2016 1 check-in Perfectly fine coffee shop. The coffee is good, but nothing outstanding. Their Drip of the Day was a bit too watery for me. Had to add a lot of sugar to it. Their mocha was very good though, nice and full-flavored.  The interior was pretty neat. Understated with plenty of seating. Perfect place to be on a chilly, rainy day. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in I'd be wanting to try this spot for a long time and when the opportunity finally presented itself, I eagerly jumped!  After circling the lot a few times for a parking spot, I contemplated if this was worth a to-go latte, but I was determined. The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of customers of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing atmosphere with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for people looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice patio in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.  While there's definitely not a sense of urgency with the wait staff, it was more the lack of customer service that left a little more to be desired for me. In addition, compared to the standard sizes seen elsewhere in coffee shops, the large was more like a small. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/3/2016 I'm not sure what it is about this place, but I feel like every time I step foot in it I am being silently judged by the baristas, like they don't think I'm jiggy-enough-with-it to be in their presence. I also think it's strange they only have 2 or so latte flavors... the first time I visited I desperately scanned their tiny menu for even a hint of options, but alas, vanilla it was.  I can't quite explain it, just something about the vibe here makes me wanna whip my phone out and Google Map other coffee shops. ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 2/4/2016 8 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Epoch has a wonderful hipster vibe to it - great ambience and really chill, friendly workers. They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/29/2016 3 check-ins This location is on par with it's OG location (North Loop) it terms of drinks and the atmosphere is pretty good. I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first opened they used to make snacks and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be open until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be open 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The music. It's way too loud most of the time. I just heard a lady say ""it's too loud in here I can't hear you let's go outside"". The baristas often have the music BLASTING to where you will have a hard time hearing the person in front of you. I can't think. Don't even try talking a call inside... They also play weird shit. Play something your general customer population will enjoy, I'm not into your 80s metal. *** As I am writing this! A second group of moved out side ""is it quite out there?"" *** ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 7/31/2016 The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/16/2016 This place has great coffee and pastries.  However, it's hit or miss with the baristas.  Some are lovely and friendly, others are typical hipster with an attitude.

Epoch Coffee ," 6/10/2016 I'm not from Austin, but I've been to more than few coffee shops here. When I'm staying in North Austin, Epoch is my new fave. There's plenty of space, a back area with tables, and super fast wifi. Like legit. I went to another spot in east Austin and they were rocking dial up...like for real. I heard the modem times when trying to connect (older folks know what I'm talking about). Anyway, there's no problem with connectivity at Epoch. Plus, the bartenders are super friendly. What more do you need when you're writing/studying/on a blind date? It's comfortable and the coffee is great. Check it out next time your in north Austin. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 9/1/2015 1 check-in I really liked the original Epoch location near airport blvd. I have good memories there, drinking coffee with my friends and eating good pasteries. I saw this new location when I was going to Madam mam's for lunch and instrantly I kenw that that is the place that I would like to go for a cup of coffee after the lunch.  I like this place, the atmosphere, and nice people working there. Everyhing should be above four strats. Except, the taste of coffee. I am not a coffee expert so my taste toward coffee may be very particular. I like dark french roast but when I tried the ""regular"" drip coffee. It was very sour. I know some coffee beans (or the type of roasting) have sour flavor but that's not the style of coffee that I prefer. So this review may be very skewed.  Definetly a good location and parking is fairly easy. Coffee break ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/21/2016 Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seats taken by people with laptops and tablets, but still more than adequate seating.  Barista's seemed chill and friendly enough for me. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/6/2016 Meh. I was excited to try a new coffee shop while I was on this side of town. I wasn't greeted at all, no smile, no thank you by the cashier nor the barista. Coffee was decent tasting but not even that hot. I guess I'm not cool enough for this place. ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 6/15/2015 1 check-in I agree with the general star rating for this location... Call me picky! and I am when it comes to my coffee... :D especially if they set my expectations for good coffee, and especially if they have some good tools to make it... Also I expect that hip vibe from the place, stylish cups and warm welcome environment. Epoch disappointed on a few of those parameters... The space is large, but lacks style and atmosphere, feels like an old sandwich shop that was rented for, what I expected to be, a great coffee shop.  Now, my cappuccino... It's espresso and foam, people! A lot of foam (not macchiato) and not much milk (not a latte). It looked pretty, but was all milk inside... Sight... May be their sandwiches are great... And the Internet is pretty fast. So, may be I will be back, just make sure to have lower expectations... They still have better coffee than Starbucks, don't get me wrong :) ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/6/2016 I ordered the vanilla almond milk latte and fell in love. It's everything a latte should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The environment is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back atmosphere.  The barista was so sweet and patient with me and all of my questions. ""What's good here?"" ""Do u have vanilla almond milk?"" Ect.

Epoch Coffee ," 7/20/2014 4 check-ins I have held off on reviewing this place as I am very torn between three or four stars.  I have landed on three as I have come here several times, and have always taken my coffee away, as I am never compelled to stay here.  The coffee and staff are great, but cleanliness and ambiance are lacking.  My favorite is the cold brew coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their espresso is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the pastries are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that serves up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and sandwiches.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside patio when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.    I also like that this place is open till 12 am, which makes a quick take away coffee before heading to a late night Alamo movie convenient See all photos from Mindy H. for Epoch Coffee ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/14/2015 1 check-in On convenience, really good wireless connectivity. friendliness ...they are really really good, but if rating them on coffee...it is definitely meh.  But then not everyone is obsessed about that kind of stuff like me.  And when I say coffee ...I don't mean a latte, but a pour over or do a espresso. They guys have a pretty expensive machine to pull espressos, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.  On the other side of coin is easy accessibility, really good connection speeds, reasonable service and fairly helpful staff then ends up with this place being A-OK. A fairly pedestrian espresso. ..no discernable crema ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 5/7/2016 Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/27/2015 I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great atmosphere, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend. Keep up the good work guys! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/11/2015 I've been a regular at Epoch for a little over a year now. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.  I haven't yet had a reason not to return. The plentiful parking and convenient north location are also big wins. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 3/20/2014 Updated review 6 check-ins This was my favorite new discovery, but sadly it did not last. Parking had always been awful, but there has not been any seating the last two times I've gone in and prices were just increased $0.50 for all drinks (except the cortado, I think). I know $0.50 isn't a lot, but the original prices were already higher than Starbucks and I don't feel like Epoch deserves any slack for mispricing when they have had another store open for years to experiment with. Also, my usual cappuccino had always been served in their bigger cups (about 12 oz) and they just recently downsized all drinks (except mochas, as far as I can tell) to their small cups (about 8 oz).  Updated prices, for reference:  Cappuccino: $3.25 to $3.75 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Latte: $3.50 to $4.00 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Mocha: $3.75 to $4.25 (Starbucks Tall = $3.25) Drip: $2.00 to $2.50 (Starbucks Tall = $1.65)  If you're rich and willing to pay a buck more for less coffee, of course Epoch tastes better. But if you're a poor student like me, back across the street to Starbucks it is... New menu as of 05/06/14, but careful because it'll probably be completely different tomorrow ", neutral

They also sell it by the package to enjoy at home.  Ritual was started in the heart of the Mission district in San Francisco by Eileen Hassi in 2005. I remember when I worked at Flora Grubb Gardens Eileen teaching me about coffee flavors and roasting while she hand stamped her paper cups with a rubber stamp.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/18/2013 118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art.

Epoch Coffee ," 1/24/2016 This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces. ", pos

Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/9/2014 Updated review I like Epoch coffee still. Clean lines, fast wifi, great A/C, new outside seating. I haven't resampled food and I'm not going to buy those pastries sitting there since 8am.  Here's the gig though. It's been 7 months and that bathroom is still a broken down mess. The door to the second stall is still off. The towel dispenser is hanging open like a gaping maw with sodden roll of towel on top. The one bathroom that does function has grimy floors and the TP is off the roll sitting on the handicap bar.  There are 30 people in here and one lonely barista trying to do it all which makes wait times long and her life miserable (I'm sure.) I expect some of these things at the old location which is arguably less put together but I thought they'd fix some of these things in the half year they've been open. ", neutral

Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot.

I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.

There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back.

Epoch Coffee ," 5/10/2015 The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 2/19/2014 3 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.

I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.

They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups.

I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 12/20/2013 21 check-ins ROTD 4/28/2014 This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

This location has a more modern feel to it than the other location, which is nice...I like having diversity without having to sacrifice deliciousness! They'll get another star out of me when they increase they're bakery/food options! Can a girl get a danish or a piece of cake?? ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/17/2014 I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place opened up here. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/16/2014 1 check-in I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/21/2015 11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart. ", pos

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee.

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot! ", pos

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/23/2016 1 check-in My husband and I paid a visit to Houndstooth after reading several positive reviews online, reporting this coffee shop as one of the best in Austin.  After trying it for ourselves, I have to admit they do serve excellent coffee; my tasty iced latte was very well made. My husband's chai latte was delicious and among the best we've had in the city.  That being said, I found myself a bit shocked when I looked at the bill; the coffee cup size was smaller than what I usually get at other third wave coffee shops, yet the cost was at least a dollar more expensive. Yes, the coffee is good, but is it THAT good? My wallet isn't so sure!  Another point that left me disappointed was the pastries; not only was the selection very limited, but upon asking if the barista could reheat my croissant, he reply they couldn't as they do not have a microwave and that they probably never will have one as they fear customers would ask them to use it to reheat their coffee. Hum, what?  No, I don't want you to put my croissant (or cold coffee for that matter) in the microwave. That's disgusting. I would think however it would be a really smart idea to invest in a mini oven used to bake fresh parties or simply reheat them for 30 seconds. My croissant was cold and a bit lifeless. This problem could so easily be fixed! The way I see it, if you're going to do pastries, do it right or not at all, especially with the high prices you are asking your customers to pay!  Will I be back? I don't know. I'm kind of thrown off by the attitude and prices. That being said, Houndstooth does have great coffee and deserves its fame in that department. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/3/2016 1 check-in Houndstooth has the best coffee quality in Austin. A little pricy for the size, but the coffee is always great and tasty.  Baristas are all very knowledgeable and kind. They know how to use their fancy coffee brewer and make pretty coffee art. Also, the guys are always well-dressed with nice button down shirts, bow ties and hats. Heh  The shop itself is pretty small, very limited seating with nice decors. When you come during rush time, you'll usually not able to find spots. But the coffee is great to go as well.  Music is a bit too loud and repetitive  music was annoying at times.

I usually hate picking favorites, favorite restaurant, favorite movie, favorite drink, etc. It's such a stressful decision with so many factors. But, Houndstooth is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Austin. It's the only place I get cappucino and know to expect only goodness. They're always consistent, and the baristas friendly.  The only con of this place is that outlets are pretty sparse and the seatings tend to be full most of the time I've gone. It's not a cafe I would study at, but definitely to drop by for a cup to-go or a chatty time with a friend or two.  Oh how I'm going to miss Houndstooth! ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/9/2016 First, I'm going to say the 5 stars are for the quality, flavor, atmosphere and overall experience. To read the one hang-up please scroll to the end. We both got mochas. The wait time was good, the baristas are visible and engaging, and you can really tell this is their craft. They love making coffee, and it shows. The aroma when you walk in is delicious and our drinks raised our eyebrows. Even though it was busy we had no problem finding a seat. We were in there about 90 minutes and the line was never shorter than 5 people. I do think they should have a visible menu though.  My one dismay was the cost. We got a 12oz mocha and a 16oz mocha and it was TWELVE DOLLARS. Twelve dollars!!!!!!! By far the most expensive coffee we've ever had, but they had hundreds of customers lined up so it doesn't seem to deter people. The quality was top notch, but I still don't see how you justify that price. Mocha See all photos from Ashley K. for Houndstooth Coffee ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/1/2015 9 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Houndstooth is one of my favorite places to study; the environment is great and the place is clean and comfortable. I've only been to the Lamar location, but I really like it!  As for the beverages,  they definitely take their craft seriously at Houndstooth and have several 'daily brews' to choose from. I think Houndstooth has some of the most talented baristas in Austin. Not a place to go if you're looking for something similar to Starbucks' sugary, fake coffee beverage; this is the real deal.  I haven't quite decided if the great bitter taste that I love about Houndstooth is worth the hefty price associated with their drinks. I do really love their coffee, and would prefer it over a lot of other places in Austin, but the price deters me from visiting often.  Also, if you don't prefer the rich coffee taste, I wouldn't come here. I took my sister here who is less favorable with the bitter taste and she had to add quite a bit of sugar to her drink in order to tolerate it.  Upsides: Quality coffee, nice bathrooms, friendly workers  Downsides: Limited menu, hard to find seating during busy hours, super pricey ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/27/2016 I just had the best experience here. I wish I had the name of the girl who helped me. I told her I had coffee-loving family members coming in town and needed help with buying the right coffee. She took her time to explain everything in great detail and even asked a co-worker for a second opinion. I was coming straight from a surgery, so her energy and attitude really lifted my spirits. Obviously, I know little about coffee but this experience will most definitely bring me back. Thank you to this sweet employee. Your kindness did not go unnoticed. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 4/19/2016 1 check-in My go-to drink is an iced caramel latte. When a place doesn't have caramel, I opt for vanilla and cinnamon. But houndstooth had vanilla and honey so that's what I ordered. Because I love honey and I'm trying to stop myself from adding syrup or sugar to my coffee after receiving it.  Sweet enough to satisfy me while still letting the coffee flavor (the bitterness) to seep through.  Not enough outlets so that's why I'm docking a star. If I could, I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars because of lack of seating as well. Coffee is a solid 4-5 stars. For some reason, all the outlets are in the back corner of the place, which doesn't make sense considering there's a huge AF table for community seating at the front, but with no outlets around it.

Well.. my tolerance for coffee isn't that insane, so I only need a cup of their hot brewed black coffee and I'm good for the day.  My friend and I always come here after we finish our meal at Tacodeli (next door, check it out!!!!). It's always packed and not exactly a super large shop, so I wouldn't come here to study. It has kind of a hipster vibe cuz on the wall it says ""the pattern of coffee and people"", there's a big shiny fancy machine, and the (very nice) baristas always dress hipster and have big glasses/mustaches.  One time, I had some ""hot"" chocolate-flavored donut recommended by the cashier but it was really weird... I expected cinnamon or something but it was just some actual spicy donut with a bad aftertaste.... Idk yo but after that experience, I would just stick to ordering their coffee. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/7/2016 Great coffee and environment equally conducive to work, chit-chat or a break at the same time. Yes parking is a problem, just like it is in pretty much any place in downtown. The baristas know their craft, and they don't mind telling you about it either.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 4/17/2016 Based on a rainy Saturday afternoon:  Pros: -interesting layout; really puts the coffee front and center -baristas were VERY friendly and helpful -mocha didn't blow me away, but it was satisfying and had lovely latte art  Cons: -it was super packed 2-5pm with an almost overwhelming amount of noise. By 6:30 it was much calmer and more enjoyable, so it really matters when you go -there are only outlets on one wall of the coffee shop  If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars. I see why people like it, but I think there's a lot of variance in the actual experience you might have there. Would definitely be up for another visit to get a better feel for it Mocha ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/20/2015 2 check-ins Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee Houndstooth is serving up fantastically wonderful coffee, and it is no wonder why they were packed when a friend and I dropped in mid-day on Thursday. The many different types of low chairs, high chairs, outdoor patio seating, and a bar to stand at were pretty much fully packed. There was also a fairly consistent line and the baristas were flowing through orders smoothly. There were a lot of people working, and a lot of people meeting up to sit and enjoy the space.  We both ordered lattes and were seriously blown away by the smoothness of the coffee. It had no bitter qualities, wasn't overly dry, (think like a dry wine on the tongue) and there was a perfect balance between the milk, coffee, and ice in the lattes. I think I paid around $4.50 for my coffee - and for the quality, it is an incredibly fair price. I really can't say enough good things about this place - I just wish it was closer to home for me, I'd probably stop in weekly! ", pos

It feels trendy and cool and hip all at the same time, while delivering on an amazing guest experience.

And, being a Houndstooth, the coffee and the service were good (very good cappuccino - I wasn't surprised), BUT...it's tiny! Tiny, tiny, tiny! So little seating! It was raining outside, so the tables out there were wet and there wasn't any available seating inside - we ended up getting our coffees to go and taking them back to her apartment!

The barista was funny (with just the right level of haughtiness you would expect from someone capable of making such a top-notch drink), and the cafe was clean and spacious.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/24/2015 Listed in Thanks a latte! Came in for the first time today in years, just a few minutes after they opened and there was already a small line forming. The advantage to the early morning stop is that you don't have to brave the busy parking lot that fills up rather quickly and it seemed that the barista there was already peppy and ready to take on the day. I watched her joke and laugh along with the girl in front of me, who mentioned she was a 6:30am regular.  Half asleep, I waited at the front while she filled their order, and she kindly asked me what she could get started for me. As I was answering, the man behind me said ""one vanilla latte..oh sorry, didn't see her there."" I rolled my eyes at him as he looked up from his phone. I now had resting bitch face. She replied, seeing my frustration ""I'm sorry, I will get your order in just a minute"" then turning to me ""what would you like?"" I knew before I even answered that this wasn't going to work out. I'm just not the right fit. But I didn't care, none of my regular spots were on my way this morning, Starbucks was closed, and I was running late.  So I halfheartedly asked her what flavored syrups they have for their lattes. She kind of trailed off ""vanilla...honey...."" Luckily, that was just fine. Honey is what I wanted. So I paid for my honey latte to go, remarking ""oh that is so pretty"" when she brought me my drink and tipping her. But I didn't get a smile or a laugh. My resting b* face cost me my morning greeting.  Its not Houndstooth's fault that I found the dude behind me to be a d*. Nor is it their fault that my usual haunts just weren't convenient enough for me today. If I had had more of a pleasant experience coming in today, I would have excused the fact that I paid a little more for a small latte. I will say that as hesitant as she was with the flavors, the honey is spot on. Creamy and rich with just that hint of sweetness. If I was going to meet someone for a quick coffee run or post up with a coworker to update our social media accounts, I might choose houndstooth again.  But bottom line: I'm just not cool enough for this place. ", neutral

However, the ambience at this location is nice. The baristas are very well-educated and know their coffee! If you ever have any questions, don't be afraid to ask them!  Parking can be tough here.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/6/2016 Full disclosure: I'm kind of a cheap person. I'm also a coffee lover. As a result, I'm one of those people who thinks that if I'm paying upwards of $8 for an expresso drink, it had better be delicious. Enter Houndstooth, my very favorite coffe shop.  Even though I live in San Antonio, I try to hit this place up every time I'm in Austin. I have been to both locations several times, and whenever I pull into the parking lot, my wallet starts to tremble. Because just about every time I've been here, I've ended up spending ~$40 for a couple of drinks and a bag of beans to take home. Recall, I'm a confessed penny pincher. Never once have I regretted shelling over my precious monies to Houndstooth. It has been worth it every single time.  If you're someone who has a go-to drink you normally order at coffee shops, give it a try here. Chances are you've never had it made as well as these people are going to make it. But if you're the adventurous type--and I would highly enoucourage you to be in this case--check out their seasonal specials. From the chilled coffee julep in the summer to the precious 'Ginger in the Snow' they featured this past Christmas, I have thoroughly enjoyed their seasonal offerings throughout the year.  I should probably note that I've rarely been here during the morning rush. Most of my visits have been later in the day, and there's usually at least a person or two ahead of me. It's like the locals have started catching on to how good this place is. Alas, I guess I'll have to share...

Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/9/2015 A fan for sure. I love this little coffee shop. My experience with Houndstooth was in the evening. The owner/manager was so sweet and talked about all the different coffees they offered, explaining the brewing process with great detail.  This tells me they are passionate about a good cup of coffee and that speaks to this coffee lover.  I went to Houndstooth for an after-dinner coffee experience and it was the perfect setting. If we wanted a fast-food type coffee run with yelling baristas, paper cups and our names spelled wrong, we would've gone to Starbucks, but we weren't looking for that type of atmosphere.  We wanted to take our time, talk, drink from a real ceramic cup, and enjoy our adult time away from the kids.  The music was great, the vibe was calm, mature, and peaceful.  I saw a few patrons enjoying a cup of coffee and reading a book; it's a great place for that.    We can't wait to return on another date night. the perfect latte ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/30/2016 My first visit to Houndstooth was delightful; it lives up to its reputation as one of the best coffee houses in Austin. The interior is clean, refined, and simple, as are their equipment and ceramics. The baristas were incredibly friendly and offered suggestions on different beans or blends for my espresso and cappuccino.  My espresso was brewed using Natalio Flores Ojeda, a single-origin Peruvian bean by Roseline. It had tangerine notes and was bright and pleasant. The milk chocolate flavors in the Hologram blend from Counter Culture Coffee paired well with the creamy milk in my cappuccino--just as the barista suggested it would.  All in all, one of the best coffee experiences I had in Austin. You won't be disappointed. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/7/2015 Houndstooth espresso makes my taste buds smile. I usually rotate between the cortado, latte, and cappuccino- all of which are excellent. The staff has a great attitude and is really talented with latte art that never fails to put a smile on my face. Houndstooth has limited space for studying, but is perfect for a quick drink or for togo.  I can't help but think that the placement of Tacodeli next to Houndstooth is more than a divine coincidence, but grabbing breakfast tacos and a cup of coffee has become a weekend routine for me.

The staff is always friendly and helpful, and they are patient when I'm taking a lifetime to decide on which coffee I want.

I try making it at home but some how it always seems to tast better at the coffee house.  I'm always in search of the perfect cup. The industrial decor alerts the consumer that Houndstooth takes their business seriously. The menu is small,  which isn't a bad thing if the product is exceptional. This place never fails to impress me. My cappacino was topped off with an adorable heart in the foam. The only issue I have is that the serving size of these cups of perfection are tiny. I honestly would need to order 3 to fulfill my desire for caffeine. (Don't judge me)  They also offer a small array of baked goods, they are tastey and seem to pair well with the coffee.

There is something to be said on the distinction of said distractions, but there definitely is such a thing as 'too distracting'.    This cafe' is the best thing that happened to me over the Summer. I love their clean decor - the focus being their coffee. They offer a distinct selection, not too vast, but then that's not the point is it? I got a great cup of beautifully brewed coffee. Simple.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/7/2015 1 check-in Listed in {AUSTIN}. Wonderful coffee shop!  FOOD AND DRINK: (4.5/5) I ordered a vanilla cortado, and I really, really enjoyed it. It was the perfect consistency, and the espresso + milk was smooth and delectable. Everything was wonderful. They also sold a small assortment of pastries if you're hungry, but honestly, the coffee was so great. Probably some of the best coffee I've ever had.  AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: (5/5) Wow, wonderful, wonderful, and wonderful. The baristas were extremely friendly and helpful; they were able to help my non-coffee-drinker friends figure out exactly what they wanted. When there wasn't a line at the counter, the two baristas were always working: wiping tables, sweeping the floors, cleaning the espresso machine, etc. This would definitely explain how everything was kept so clean and orderly, and made the whole experience more enjoyable.  The ambiance is very cozy. This is a pretty small coffee shop, but full of soft light and is very quiet. Plenty of outlets along the walls, so this would be a good place to bring your work and be super productive.  PARKING: (4/5) Houndstooth shares a lot with other stores in the same plaza (including Uchiko). Unfortunately, quite a few of the parking spots are designated ""10 minutes"" or ""30 minutes"", but there should still be plenty of spots remaining if you want to stay longer. I'm just thankful that we found a coffeeshop that wasn't limited to street parking at all.  COME AGAIN?: Yes, absolutely! If I wanted to get some work done, this is definitely the place I would go. However, I'm not sure if I would come here to hang out with a friend; it's a little quiet for my taste. But there are certainly benefits for that as well. Highly recommended! latte + vanilla cortado ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/4/2016 This is a great coffee shop. It's a little cramped inside, but still plenty of seating. They were offering Counter Culture and Tweed coffees the morning my wife and I went in. I was disappointed that the only drip offering was a blend. We ordered two pour overs: the Konga and Idido--both single origin coffees from Counter Culture. Definitely pricey for the size--almost $5 for a 16oz and they were not filled up all the way. I'm a snob, so I'll just say that both drinks were a little diluted (I've brewed a bag of the Idido at home so I know what it's supposed to taste like). Still very good coffee though. Cool vibe, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, good selection of pastries. I would definitely recommend. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/27/2015 My favorite coffee! Wish houndstooth came to New York / California. The beans are amazing, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgable, very nice ambience, and right in between tacos and uchiko!! :) 10/10 would recommend Flat white for $4.25 ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/8/2016 Came here with my sister and since it was a bit late, we opted for green mint iced teas.

Well-lit, plenty of seating, fast wi-fi.  It seems like everyone here knows each other, or maybe everyone is just really frigging friendly, but it definitely feels like the neighborhood place where everyone knows your name. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/16/2014 I had a lovely cappuccino there.  I am no coffee expert so I felt a bit overwhelmed immediately.  There was a line of people behind me so I just went the safe route.  It was a bit cramped while I was there presumably because many people had Veteran's Day off.  There was no place to sit and it made waiting a little awkward.  The gal at the register was really nice, the barista, more chilly, but he was hustling and put a lovely design in my foam.  That sounds so risqué. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/13/2015 Great coffee. Baristas are coffee geeks. The roasts that were on offer were not the generic kinds; some thought had gone into their selection. Good relaxing ambience. Music was not too loud. The latest issue of Barista magazine was on the counter. Latte art was cool. Parking is tight in this complex though. This is the only place I've had a drink they call a cortado. I enjoyed it very much, and the wife enjoyed her latte. Banana bread was good as well (large enough that it must be shared).

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/27/2015 The drinks are good and I found the building clean and the staff friendly. I just can't give any more than three stars because the price doesn't seem worth it for the coffee.  Like a few other reviewers, I think I'm just not cool enough for Houndstooth. I think their espresso just tastes like... espresso... so why is it so expensive? Their drip coffees (which are what I really wanted) were actually too confusing for me to order. ", neutral

They're very consistent with their coffee every time and it's always on point.

They're very knowledgeable when it comes to coffee too!  It is a bit overpriced but I personally think it's worth the money.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/15/2015 Heard about Houndstooth while living in Hawaii. After moving to Austin, was able to finally try this place out while stopping by Taco Deli. I only tried the iced coffee without sugar/cream, it was perfect! Not too bitter or too watery. I'm very picky when it comes to coffee. I've started to step away from lattes, been wanting more of the coffee taste rather than milk.  Definitely coming back to try their other brewed coffees! ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/6/2014 I don't understand why people complain that this place is full of snobby baristas and hipsters. It's not.

If you don't understand the coffee offerings (I rarely do, I just go in with an idea of what I feel like drinking), they are glad to explain what things are to you. There is enough seating to satisfy the place on a non-busy day, which is good.

Walking into the place, you'll see those nice shiny espresso machines that'll make you want to quit your job and become a barista.  My favorite is the Iced Vanilla Latte. Watching them make it is amazing; you can tell it's good quality coffee when it takes a while to make.  I will admit that the drinks are pricey; it's always painful taking out my wallet here. But when you have coffee as good as theirs...how can you not get some?!  The place is pretty small and it gets crowded in the afternoons. If you're here to lounge around, I would say you have a 30% chance of getting a spot. It's good for grabbing a coffee to go with a friend though. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/9/2014 Some of the reviews written for Houndstooth is funny. A bad review because the barista was lacking a smile...or a certain roast for that day?  Anyhow.. both my experiences were quite pleasant. The cortados here really do live up to its name. The baristas are knowledgable such that if you present what kind of flavor you're looking for, they may suggest a certain roast for the drink you desire.  Over the past weekend's visit, I've tasted both its iced latte and a cortado. Great stuff. The barista there even suggested me to visit Figure-8 coffee in East Austin. Another great place. Love the atmosphere. Seems to be a cyclists' hangout over the weekend mornings. Great vibe. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/3/2015 First thing when I visit a city... find a place that serves good coffee. So, after looking at the reviews, I headed over to Houndstooth on the first day of a four day stay in Austin and ended up going back every day.  The pourover is done with a Clever filter which is a bit different than using a Chemex. Rather than pouring the water over and letting the coffee drip into the carafe, the water is steeped in the coffee grounds in the Clever. When it's done, the coffee then drains into a glass jar and then poured into the coffee cup. In my opinion, the coffee is a bit more robust than a simple pourover done with a Chemex  What Houndstooth does well is finding great coffee beans from some of the best roasters in the US - Counterculture, PT's, etc. I enjoyed some Amore de Dios (the love of God in Spanish) from CC and it was nothing short of amazing.  The only downside to Houndstooth are the pastries. We tried a couple of scones on the first day and they were just ok. But frankly, when you can head next door to Tacodeli, it's a huge win... great coffee and a breakfast taco!! ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/13/2013 11 check-ins I love Houndstooth Coffee. The baristas have been consistently pleasant from my morning experiences, the rotating coffee specials are always great picks and yummy flavors, and they have a great house coffee. They DO offer cappuccinos, but this isn't really the place for those. Their prices are a little bit higher than some of the other places in town but I think the tastes are by far better.  Rotating coffee specials are on the left when approaching the register and their major notes are listed to make choosing easier. Same with espressos, which are served with a small glass of (I think) Topo Chico for cleansing the palette, according to my friend Helen.  It's definitely different from other ""coffeeshops"" in that I'm not sure I feel too comfortable studying here for extended periods of time--the word I would describe it with isn't exactly ""cozy.""  Warm even? No. Enjoyable and modern, but in the tiniest bit I'd compare it to Medici in terms of feel tables and chairs-wise. I'd say it's a Hudson, a Brannan, or maybe a Walden whereas some other coffeeshops would be something like Kelvin or Valencia. Yeah.. I went there. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/4/2014 I stumbled into this place this morning, looking for a delicious cappuccino to wake me up. Houndstooth didn't disappoint. They're a multi-roast coffee shop, so there are a few different bean options. I went with one called Koava for my cappo, and it was perfect. The right ratio of milk to espresso (aka not too much milk. Ahem, Starbucks), and a great machine that made the espresso the correct way (not burnt).  The people there were really friendly. The atmosphere was okay...not exactly a cozy place but nice enough. Pricing wise-a little steep. My cappo was 4.80. The coffee was great though so I'll come back again. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 12/7/2013 8 check-ins Listed in ATX Coffee Fix I'll preface this review by stating that I think I'm the odd one out on Houndstooth--I've never found the appeal of this place among my peers--please take no offense.  It's always hard to find parking here and the coffee shop is too small in my opinion--it probably seats a max of 25 people. It's a chore in itself to find a seat unless you like sitting outside during the wintertime. On another note, I've always felt awkward staying here as you could easily spot me from the crowd of hipsters at this place.  People come here for the coffee as the baristas know what they are doing but I also go to coffee shops to get work done and sadly the availability of electrical sockets at this place is zilch. The Internet speed is okay but not as quick as Monkey Nest's. Confession: sometimes I just order my coffee to go and work from Starbucks close by. ", neutral

Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/25/2014 1 check-in Before I begin my review, I just want to say that I am by no means a coffee connoisseur! Hand picked Colombian coffee house roasted and freshly ground vs instant coffee tastes basically the same to me. As a result I basically like my coffee 10% coffee, 40% milk, and 50% sugar. Therefore, I normally just drown any coffee given to me in copious amounts of sugar, honey, and sweetener (yay diabeetus).  BUT my experience at houndstooth was mucho different-o. I ordered a vanilla latte with Rustico espresso (i have no idea what that is but the friendly barista recommended it). Just as I was about to nuke it with sugar, I decided to give it a sip first. MMMMMMMMMMMMMM much taste, such good! Didn't even need sugar. I believe that's truly a testament to the quality of Houndstooth coffee. So far its the best quality coffee I have tried in Austin!  Other notes: This place is very cozy, but its a downright terrible place if you want to get work done. It's quite loud, has like zero outlets, and very few actual tables. Come here to chat and enjoy good coffee. Don't bother trying to study!  Overall: I loved the coffee, but I probably won't be a regular. $5.10 for a small cup of coffee is to luxurious for a poor college student D: ", pos

The baristas are nice and helpful, and there is enough light in the store for good Instagrams as well. There is a couch in one corner that is perfect for socializing or reading the newspaper, and bar seating as well as small tables perfect for your laptop. Honestly just a really pretty shop.

This coffee shop has very nice staff that answered all my question I had about their menu and is very knowledgeable when it comes to making a perfect coffee. In my case I asked for a latte, but I am sure they are perfect with every other coffee you can ask for. Even that I took my sweet time, they didn't want to hurry me as coffee takes it time and to choose the right one also can take a minute or two. You never want to go for the wrong one. The place itself has different tables and such and I sat down at a bar type table. The comfy ones were already taken and I didn't want to re-seat.  On a side note, they have some water ready to get it yourself, and reusable water cups, I like that. Together with the real cups this would give them an extra point but I can only give five points all together.  I will be back if I find parking in the area. ", pos

Being a nurse, coffee is my life blood, so I stopped by this hip little cafe and ordered up a latte.  I love that here, that doesn't mean an overly sweet confection like those chain places.  I do love a non-sweet hand pulled latte and this was a good one!  There is plenty of seating in the cafe and the decor is very urban industrial, think resto hardware, but lots of little pockets and alcoves for an intimate conversation.

Caffé Medici ," 6/26/2016 1 check-in This place is legit! Their coffee is amazing. I ordered an iced coffee which as simple as it sounds was incredible.  Yeah!

In the plaza with shake shack, high ball and at least four other restaurants. Lick ice cream right next door and smoothie place. ", pos 
Caffé Medici ," 5/23/2016 1 check-in I love Caffe Medici! I usually go to the location on Guadalupe across UT Austin, but I came here with my family for a late afternoon coffee since we were in the neighborhood. You get what you'd expect from Medici: friendly service, a modern-yet-cozy ambiance, and damn good coffee. I just got a normal drip coffee this time I went, and it well-outperforms its competitors even in this department. They really do use high quality coffees and brew with care; the product reflects it. My coffee (which I had black, no cream or sugar) was smooth, fruity, and hardly astringent whatsoever. I'm glad to see that no matter which location you go to, you can experience the same great product!  Also, while their store may not have the most seating, they make up for it with a generous amount of outdoor seating. And this is really a nice place to have outdoor seating; there are enough pedestrians and great, ""urban"" views. ", pos

Caffé Medici , 3/30/2016 1 check-in I have only been here once and it was a great experience. This place has a eclectic design to it. That meaning random mirrors and decor everywhere. Is that a bad thing? absolutely not. Now the coffee I got was an ice coffee but not just any ice coffee cold brew. OH but not just cold brew a concentrated one where milk is added and vanilla sweetener. So yes it put a pep in my step and it was really good to wash my smash burger down. I high recommend that kind of cold brew. They have a regular cold brew as well. I will be back if Im ever back in austin.  also apparently a great place to do computer work and homework. , pos 
Caffé Medici ," 2/29/2016 Great vibe, good coffee, great prices on the wines by the bottle as well.

This coffee shop has 3 things every coffee shop need: good coffee, fast Wifi, and great ambience. I was sold.  This location just opened and for a Monday evening, it was quite empty. The baristas were friendly and greeted us when we came in. I ordered what I usually get - an Iced Vanilla Latte. The prices are kind of steep, but my coffee was a perfect combination of espresso & milk, so I think it's quite worth.  I do wish they have more pastry options though~  Plenty of seats, outlets, and there's even a cute little patio outside!  You can park in the parking garage for Alamo Drafthouse.

Caffé Medici , 4/9/2016 I went here this morning with two of my daughters and my son-in-law for coffee and breakfast. We arrived at about 10 AM. They were down to their last three breakfast tacos. My daughter told me that they don't make the food there it is brought in from another vendor and they were simply very busy that morning and had sold out. We got the last of the tacos. So we also ordered some muffins and pastries. My taco was beans and pico de gallo. It was good but not as warm as I would like even though they heated up in the toaster oven. My blueberry muffin was dry and not very tasty. The coffee was good coffee. I just drink regular black coffee so I'm not into the exotics. The girls each had a chai latte which they thought was very good. My son-in-law have a cappuccino and he said that was good as well. All in all it was decent but not anything special. And of course being located in the Lemar union complex everything was a little pricey. It was a coffee shop. Not worth any extra time to travel there. The view of the river from our table Cubano was tasty but the ham was cold. Vegetarian sandwich with fries git a rave review from my daughter. , neutral 
Caffé Medici ," 3/26/2016 1 check-in They have a very small selection of drinks, plus some pastries and pre-wrapped sandwiches and snacks.

Caffé Medici ," 11/4/2015 1 check-in Listed in Give me coffee or give me death! I like this location more because it's near the Alamo Drafthouse, which is a great place to wait before the movie starts. Also you can go there after the film is over and hang out. There's also free parking which is a major plus. Medici is a fancy coffeehouse with modern furniture. In the middle of the coffeehouse is where the counter where the espresso machine is located and you can order your drinks. You have to go to the left part of the counter and you pick up your drink at the opposite counter. There are couches you can sit, tall tables, and there's outside patio sitting.

I have been to this store once and the service was great. I had only ever had their hot lattes and it was way too hot for that so I asked for recommendations for something cold and highly caffeinated. They gave me an iced toddy and it was perfect. Not too sweet, not too bland, and you could taste the strength. I finished it before I made it back to my apartment and then drank some of my friends'. Only thing I'll say, in typical American fashion, is larger sizes, plz?!!! Lol ", pos

Caffé Medici ," 7/31/2015 As I consider the vision that Cafe Medici holds, I continually find aspects of their business model that I appreciate. They don't need to have so many shops, in so many locations that necessitate high real estate premiums... yet they want to provide a common space for friends and family to gather in high-traffic areas in the city of Austin.  My friend and I considered their revenue-cost ratio and figured that this local institution could bankroll with one shop, charging a lot more in one location in which all of their efforts are directed. If you think about it, the coffee prices haven't changed much over the years... sometimes keeping things simple create the most convenience for the people in charge.  Yet, Medici provides the city with consistently good service, fair pricing, fantastic coffee... and quite the fiasco looking for parking in the vicinity of all 4 locations. I love what these guys are up to. ", pos

Flitch Coffee ," 11/25/2016 What a beautiful and fun hangout! Just a few quiet blocks away from home in my new neighbourhood, Flitch is a true gem. Knowing a LITTLE about east Austin, it felt a little off the beaten path and QUIET, which is perfect (who the hell wants to go to a noisy coffee shop...BEFORE you've had your coffee??). The little trailer is absolutely ADORABLE, and the fact that you actually go inside it to order is fun. Everything tastes fresh; it was also nice that I could get my latte made with almond milk. Yay! My favourite part was the outdoor seating area... dozens of tables, chairs, and benches, some shaded, made for a heavenly morning on a mild and sunny November day. Great way to wake up in a cheery mood. :) ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 10/30/2016 7 check-ins The coffee is excellent and I just love to hang out here. What more could you want? :)  The espresso drinks and cold brew are really delicious. And if you are looking for a sweet, delectable treat, get the iced latte with maple syrup in it! They also carry Tyson's tacos which is a big plus.  Erica the owner and usual barista is super friendly and makes great stuff. Her dog Jake is a super sweet pup that is always hanging out on the trailer's deck. Speaking of the trailer, what a beautifully outfitted thing. She found it on Craigslist and her boyfriend, now hubby (congrats y'all) of neighboring Hatch Workshop created a super cool, wood-paneled interior. I believe he also made the awesome furniture you can use outside.  The ginormous pecan tree that easily provides shade for the entire seating area is a huge perk. I love Tillery Street's greenery, which provides a wonderful backdrop for you to enjoy as you sip your drink. I can't wait to spend more time here, especially as it cools down more this Winter!

Flitch Coffee ," 9/28/2016 7 check-ins Such an adorable trailer tucked away in East Austin! I love this spot because it's quiet and peaceful and there is plenty of outdoor seating, good for a date or an outing with some girlfriends.  Their iced maple latte is probably the best flavored iced latte in Austin in my opinion. It has a light but sweet flavor that doesn't overpower the coffee. Their hot espresso drinks are also good.  Not to mention, the owner's dog is the cutest! Overall the vibes this trailer gives off and the great coffee they serve makes this a definite new favorite. They also give out free postcards! ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 5/10/2016 4 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"" If you think it's tough following Austin's new restaurants, try keeping up with the coffee places. Flitch and Fleet are the newest local players, I think they're both great, and I'll meet you at either one. In fact, tell me which one you like, and I'll tell you what you are. Okay, I borrowed that line from a Starbucks in France.  I could tell you what beans they're using, but really, do you care? Trust Ms Foster's judgment. I benchmark places by their batch of straight black, but Flitch was out right before a Sunday closing, and I only had remnants from a late Tuesday morning one. But I did think my $2.50 Americano was some pretty good stuff. I know nothing about steamed milk or flavored concoctions.  I left here thinking what a clever use of a Spartan & tables, it's easy to park, and this area of Tillery street may be the last non-gentrified oasis in East Austin - hey, isn't that Jake Crane the Coffeedog? Flitch takes their coffee seriously, you'll feel welcomed here, and there's Topo Chico & WiFi. Total fanville for me. Flitch is located just south of the Tillery St Plant Co, where I thought it was going to be for some inexplicable reason. 3-4 people can sit inside the renovated Spartan, but think outside picnic tables if you're planning to hang. That's my cup, btw. ", pos

Flitch Coffee ," 7/1/2015 2 check-ins A short walk through a leafy green street in east Austin, yielded an unexpected coffee trailer in the large parking lot of a working hardware garage.  Misplaced next to an old gray cottage, with piles of fresh lumber stacked on metal tables, acting as sculpture, in this big concrete lot a quite serene tree shaded patio in the corner provided a sound meditative space for coffee and chat, as roosters crowed, ducks quacked in nearby neighbors yards, while soft sounds of construction parlayed in the back ground of this rapidly growing east austin neighborhood.  ""We're the only coffee shop this side of Pleasant Valley"", the poised pale and pretty smiling Chicago gal that wo-mans this trailer informed me as she poured my triple Americano in her simple but woodsy decor outfitted metal trailer.  I scored a strawberry pop tart from Luckys and found a cinder block to perch on for a cigarette away from the communal patio as locusts churred and birds chirped, and I sipped on a bright, acidic coffee that didn't quit taste like the full rich body of espresso but rather an excellently brewed coffee revealing a tasty bean.  The remoteness of the spot is in fact one of its high points, so come grab an easy cup from this 3 month young coffee trailer if you want to escape the brouhaha of funky east side.

There are lots of trees around and the street Flitch is on feels a lot older than a lot of other parts of town. I've only ever gotten my coffee to go but there is a little tiny space to sit inside the trailer, and lots of outdoor seating. Plenty of off street parking and some parking in the little lot they're in, too. They have tacos from Tyson's tacos and some baked goods, too.  If I enjoyed hanging out at coffee establishments I'd probably hang out here. ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 7/29/2016 Amazing coffee and a friendly Austin vibe make Flitch a must-go. Housed in a tastefully customized Airstream, you can choose to sip your yummy drink inside the lovely tiny-house-like trailer, or sprawled out under trees in the courtyard patio. It's located on the grounds of woodwork emporium Hatch, which means you sometimes get a peek at people making some very cool woodwork while walking up to the trailer. Park on Holton St for easy side access. And they have tacos in the morning too!! ", pos 
Flitch Coffee ," 9/30/2015 This is a magical little wonderland of what Austin should be about. Clean and sleek design that also draws you in to sit and relax- it reminds me of the Chelsea Highline in NYC. The trailer is so welcoming and homey without being informal, and I love that you walk inside to order. The owner is a spectacularly nice person, and it's a real treat to chat her up when I visit.  The real reason one goes back to a coffee place is of course, the coffee.  This is the ONLY place I know of in Texas to get a Maple Latté and I don't even have to bring my own maple syrup. Which I have done. So there. The espresso is rich and full but not bitter or acrid, the presentation is spot on. I love nothing more than a mapley, foamy, espresso-milk mustache, decorated with THE most perfect latte art.  My dog wants to put in his two cents:  ""Jake the dog is my friend. He works at this trailer too. We like to lie on the porch at Flitch and look at each other. Jake is nice. He smells like coffee and sunshine.""  I think that sums it up nicely. ", pos

I lost count of how much caffeine I have consumed so far today! Dead tired! Hungry af! Cranky from all of the above plus the disappointment of more misses than hits when it comes to my exploration for latte art in Austin so far. I was determined to change that after my last failed attempt looking for latte art. Plus I'm pretty delirious right now to give a fudge how many cup of coffee I have had today.  Yep, writing review for Medici while still sitting here sipping on the amazing almond milk cappuccino. I'm not drunk, just hyper, so you can still trust my words ;).  I wanted to jump seeing they offer STEVIA along with cane sugar, and brown sugar!!!! First coffee shop I have been to so far that has STEVIA option!!!!! They don't put any kind of sweetener in the latte, so I can adjust the sweet level to my liking!! Another huge point!!!  Little things matter a lot and always add up y'all!!!! They just made my night with great coffee, STEVIA, again, and the cutest/best touch complimentary tiny cookie that comes on the side with the cappuccino!!! It's delicious too!!!!  Parking is a lil pain in the ass, but just do neighborhood parking, don't park in any of the Laundry's parking spots next door or your car will get towed. Seating and coffee are definitely worth the little trouble!!!! Sugar! Brown sugar!! N STEVIA!!!!!!!!!!!!! YES!!!!!!! Delicious almond milk cappuccino!! Pretty latte art!!!! Finally!!!! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/10/2016 Great coffee in a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Okay, so I'm a little biased because I can walk here, plus I had my first date with the love of my life here, BUT for real, they make some damn good coffee drinks. These guys know their coffee, and will create your perfect beverage. The small, cozy cottage (Medici's first location) is a great place to spend a leisurely morning reading the newspaper and enjoying conversation with your squad. They have Taco Deli tacos (who doesn't these days?) and local pastries. And for all you vegans out there, they use the GOOD almond milk. Keep an ear out for your drink because this isn't Starbucks (thank goodness) and they don't take names.  This place is my go to for coffee and is worth the drive if you're not from the 'hood.

Stopped by this location because I was already in the neighborhood and decided to check it out instead of driving to my usual coffee shop - and I'm so glad I did.  This might just be the quaintest coffee shop I've been! It's like that cottage you dream of moving to one day but cannot for reasons like.. life. But now you can! Sort of. Okay you don't get the cottage to yourself, but it's so peaceful that it felt like so.  I was lucky enough to grab a window seat (there're prob only 2 desks that don't get a window view) and enjoyed the serene view of rainy Austin when I needed a break from work. Everyone around me seemed to be enthralled in their work as well (they may be checking Fb but looked real professional even so), so it's conducive to work.  This location is unique in that it's definitely Austin-y, but without going overboard (remember those uncomfortable but cool-looking furniture from that one shop? Or two?) So why only 4 stars? I'd give 10 stars for ambience! But held back by Yelp's 5 star system and their espresso. As it's a coffee shop, the final rating should be about the coffee. And 4 stars keep away the crowd away, right? ;P Cappuccino ", pos

Caffe Medici ," 11/8/2015 3 check-ins Gold standard cappuccino.  There isn't a place in Austin that serves a better cappuccino than Medici. Solid. I almost never order 2 when I'm working from a coffee shop ... except when I'm at Medici. Really sweet folks who work the bar. It's pretty packed throughout the day, but around 4:30, starts clearing out. Great little patio and lots of folks hang out there and work. At one point in my workday, I peer out the window and see a woman....with her very large per iguana perched on her table. You know. A lizard has got to get their people watch on too. I like the music. It's not obnoxious, it's not too loud. Yeah....that happened. Keep Austin weird y'all. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 6/20/2016 Super cute coffee shop built inside a older home, Cafe Medici is small, well lit and comfortable. I'm a big fan of sofa's in coffee shops- and this one has one that we kept our eye on for a while till it was free. For a small place it was still a relaxing spot to sit and read on a Sunday morning. The coffee was strong and tasty. Some outdoor seating for those that can deal with Austin heat. Worth a try for sure! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/30/2016 1 check-in Immensely enjoyed my morning at Medici's--an outstanding cup of black coffee, a delightful cappuccino, great atmosphere, and friendly service. Medici's accommodated the morning work-out crowd, the easy-Saturday-morning folks on their laptops or with their books, and little tots and their precious parents. Teamed with a friendly smile from the staff and melodious coffee, it made for a very pleasant morning. Get your coffee fix at Medici's! Delightful Medici cappuccino. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/13/2016 Cool, quiet, cute coffee shop with very good coffee and good wifi.  You can sit inside or outside.  Inside, there are a variety of tables to sit at, as well as a comfy couch.  The decor has lots of dark wood.  They have various pastries and other foods for sale, which looked good, but which I didn't get to try.  They also have self-service water which is convenient.  They have a parking lot, but it's not big and can get packed.  So walk or ride your bike here, if you can. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 10/5/2016 Here's the deal. I love Medici. The owner is a super nice guy from my hometown and I've had some really great drinks from here. This time is no different. The mocha and the black coffee were both great. I'm just really disappointed with the customer service. We walked up to the counter and the woman at the register just looked at us waiting for our order. Maybe I'm just spoiled or I expect too much, but I like to have a little friendly exchange and not just walk up and bark my order at someone. Maybe that's what she is used to, and if that's the case that is sad. She seemed to want us to just order and get out of the way and she didn't actually listen to my order, which I realized when it came out wrong. No biggy, it happens and the barista was quick to fix it. Just...come on you guys. You're better than that. ", neutral

Caffe Medici ," 4/13/2016 Absolutely love this place. I come here all the time with my wife to pick up our routine coffee and tacos. I was especially impressed with their service yesterday. We ran out of coffee at home and I wanted to bring home a bag of their beans (La Famiglia). Unfortunately, the only bags they had were too large, but the barista happily opened one and made me a smaller, 16 oz bag. He then gave us one of our coffees for free, and also ground the beans for me (I have a hand-grinder at home, so that can be pretty tedious).  Didn't even mention their coffee, but it is INCREDIBLE. The Medici folks know how to make fantastic espresso. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 5/8/2016 Terrible coffee. Absolutely the worst cup of coffee I have ever purchased at a coffee shop. The cup of coffee I got from here yesterday was not good but the cup today far exceeds the crappiness of yesterday's coffee.  Follow-up:  Went in the next day and talked with the barista. They were very nice and helpful. I've come to the conclusion that I don't like their drip coffee , neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 9/30/2015 This was the best cup of coffee I've had made for me in about 6 months, but only because I don't remember any coffee experiences prior to 6 months. So it's quite possible this could be a ""best cup of coffee ever"" scenario and I just don't know any better. So we'll give it 5 stars and adjust every 6 months, cool?  I don't think I've had any head trauma, I just don't remember. So if it isn't the best cup you've had in 7 months, I apologize for this claim, but I've made it pretty clear there's no coffee memory before the 6 month mark.  You know what, I'm going to take a star away due to how uncomfortable I felt hovering by someone's table while I was standing in line. There really is no good way to stand in a line of 4 or more people considering how congested this spot can get (remember, best coffee within 6 months of coffee brain history). I mean, there was someone trying to eat a croissant and I was practically looming over them. You can't enjoy a croissant that way! I mean, I guess you could, but probably not in this context.  Despite the poor line traffic pattern, the spot felt calm for how many people were in here. It was just a light hum of human activity, no boisterous people were present today. Except outside. Where there's lots of seating. I sat on a rock bench. It was nice.  Except for the guy talking about how to make aioli or some sort of special mayonnaise; he was the worst. But everything else was nice. ", pos

Caffe Medici ," 3/1/2016 I haven't tasted a better cup of mocha in town yet, and this town has some amazing coffee shops. The parking can be horrible, but that's because it's tucked away in the heart of downtown Austin. The atmosphere is great, always compelling art on the walls, and the baristas have always been great. I highly recommend the mocha- it's sinfully decadent. The caramel is made in house so the caramel latte is beyond tasty. I'm a classic latte kinda girl though, and it never fails to be divine. The limited space makes it very cozy, inside and out. Lots of people working, chatting, and kicking back in an old house. I have yet to try their other locations, but I am eager to!

Caffe Medici ," 1/1/2016 Nice little coffee shop that we hit on our way to the Longhorn Caverns. The latte was smooth and tasty. I would return here if in the area.  It doesn't compare to the coffees in San Francisco, but I haven't found anything that does yet. Sorry for the snobby SF comment, I can't help but compare. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/10/2015 Just another cute coffee shop tucked away in the heart of downtown Austin.  I came here on a Friday night and there was plenty of seating.  Unfortunately, there were not many pastries available.  I had a hot cup of tea and my brother had some decaf iced coffee, which he enjoyed.  Service was great.  Quiet spot to study. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 3/23/2015 The atmosphere is great and the service is really nice. Honestly the only reason for the three stars in the cost. I'm not saying it isn't worth it, I'm just saying that it is hard to justify the fact that even a small cup of coffee with nothing special approaches $3.  There are many great Coffee options in Austin, and this is one of them, just know that the cost is high before you go. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 1/17/2016 There are a lot of reasons to love, Austin, TX.  Great coffee & amazing people are some of them. Find them here at Caffe Medici in Clarksville.

Thanks for the Cheese Danishes. Thank you. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/2/2016 Good cup of coffee (a bit pricey). Very nice vibe. Limited seating in close quarters, so other people's conversations were a butt distracting. Neat spot. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/23/2015 10 check-ins I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars, but I'll be nice and give it a full 5 stars. I would only dock .5 stars due to the limited space both in terms of parking and available tables inside.  I definitely prefer this location over that on Guadalupe. There are not as many UT students, which I prefer. I'm not a big fan of coffee shops filled with UT students who are ""studying."" The coffee itself is definitely one of the best I've had in Austin. It's tough to say which is the best when you have other coffee shops like Houndstooth and Patika. However, I always decide to come to Cafe Medici simply because it's the closest to where I live.  Like I said earlier, there's seating available but not nearly as much as those available at the Medici on Guadalupe. However, if you come at the right time, you should be able to find an open table.  If you're visiting Austin or looking for a new coffee shop to check out, I'd definitely recommend coming by this place because the coffee is just always on point. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 5/31/2016 Outside of Italy one of the best cappuccinos I've had. I haven't had any other drinks because it's so good so it's what I always get. , pos

Caffe Medici ," 11/7/2015 I ordered a 12oz drip, 16oz Americano, and toasted bagel. The tab came to $9-and-change, which I thought was a bit high. However, I took a sip and both coffees were among the richest, most delicious I've ever had! You can really taste the beans. My wife preferred the Americano and thought the drip was too acidic, but I was a fan of both. It's truly coffee, not the ""coffee-flavored drink"" pawned off as coffee by many shops.  Parking is tight. There is free wifi and ample seating. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 3/24/2016 Good place and lots of room to study. My only complaint is I don't like the food options they have there very much. The coffee is good though. , pos 
Caffe Medici ," 9/16/2014 I spent Sunday morning on the porch of Caffé Medici getting to know a new friend and it was a lovely experience. The shop is in an old house. It really does a good job of making you feel like you're hanging out in a cozy living room surrounded by 15 of your closest study buddies. The front porch is a lovely addition; it's on a quiet street (or at least, Sunday mornings are quiet) but it's a nice break to hang out on the porch with a cup of coffee and watch the people stroll by.  The café uses Cuvee coffee. I wasn't familiar with that roasting company before coming to Austin, but it's everywhere around here! My cappuccino was good. A little too much milk for my personal taste, but still nowhere near the massive cups of milk with a shot that some companies try to pass off with that name (ahem, Starbucks). Ordering was easy to do and the baristas were very pleasant. All in all, it was another great coffee shop experience! ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 3/7/2016 Whenever I'm in the mood for a high quality espresso drink I know I can come here and get one. Their equipment is top of the line and their coffee beans are excellent. The location in old enfield is such a great community spot and they do a great job of handling large lines quickly without compromising quality. Love the fact that it's dog friendly! , pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/13/2016 I liked this place. Not love, but liked. Parking was a pain but once I got inside the interior is pleasant and warm, even if the decor isn't my personal preference. I ordered an iced almond milk latte (the same drink I get at every single coffee shop I go to for the first time, to gauge then against each other) and it was alright. I liked their crushed iced and the almond milk was nice and creamy, although I wish the coffee would have come through a bit stronger - I could've used an extra shot. The atmosphere was nice, as its in a renovated old home, making it feel very welcoming. My two biggest reasons it didn't get 4 stars: the music they were playing happened to be a fiddler or some type of instrument that, without even being particularly loud, seemed to cut through my headphones no matter how loud I turned my own music. Didn't love that. Secondly, I thought that the $5.10 price for my latte was a bit steep- I get it, it's Austin, but I've had better almond milk lattes for slightly cheaper elsewhere. Even knocking 25¢ off would've made it seem more reasonable & comparable. Overall, I'd come again if I was in the area and wanted some coffee. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 5/21/2014 2 check-ins I easily think that this Medici is the best location. It's easy to get to (as opposed to having to find street parking downtown or near campus), and has such a different feel than the others. Less students than the campus location, more residential locals, but all locations are pretty laidback.  This is the only location without two stories, but the pro of this one is the quaint seating on stone furniture in the front and the small patio space with a doggie bowl. The space is a repurposed home (well... you're in Austin) with great wifi, a great mixed crowd, closely spaced tables, and a feel of a friend's home or the neighborhood coffeeshop.  Even though this location has a lot, it's fairly small and often a time I've had to find parking elsewhere and walk over. This particular location is in a pretty hip part of that neighborhood, and there's always people biking by or walking their dogs outside. Oh yeah, the coffee is great too, and the baristas friendly. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 9/20/2014 1 check-in This one is okay. Not as good as the one on congress. Nice perks are patio seating, private parking and lots of outlets. Traditional toddy's and such. But, if you ask anyone local they will tell you the one on congress is better. Cortado with millk ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 8/27/2015 This is one of my favorite places to get an espresso in all of Austin! I haven't been to the new location on south lamar (right down the street from me), yet but I will soon. I LOVE the tiny spoons that they serve with the espresso, and of course the tiny biscotti that comes with it is delicious and I could eat ten million of them.

Caffe Medici ," 3/29/2014 1 check-in Stopped by while in town for SXSW. Was concerned about some of the comments but in my constant quest for good coffee I decided not to be deterred.  Since it was breakfast time, I went with the cappuccino and a berry muffin. Both were delicious. The place was busy but had no troubles finding a place to sit. Yeah, they don't have the most comfortable furniture but I don't understand why some people think buying a cup of coffee gives you the right to sit there and work all day as if it was your office.  I would give this place 4.5 stars only since they don't offer pour over goodness. Cappuccino and berry muffin ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/23/2015 Great place to kick back and grab a coffee, especially late at night. Cozy atmosphere and it's pretty quiet (due to the people studying).

Oh well, I'll visit again tho! ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 4/8/2014 1 check-in Service was courteous & they keep the espresso machine moving (or did so on our Friday morning visit).  Place is full of the usual Austin-mix (i.e., a little bit of everything).    Had a simple latte, my stable.  Though spoiled by our Tulsa-wonder-of-theworld (yelp.com/biz/doubleshot-…), I found it a capable, albeit bland latte.  Espresso had a balanced friendliness; it was lacking in the sweet part of the draw that I so love at my DS.    For reference, I no longer flavor syrup any espresso drink, at least so long as I can help it. If not engrossed in conversation, I would have headed back up to pay my $.50 or whatever to add a shot of something.  Like the environment, found it a capable cup.  Would return if ever back in this part of W 6th. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 1/18/2014 3 check-ins I cannot stop talking about the coffee here. Seriously, the best in town.  They make their own caramel syrup and every time I get a caramel latte and it's the best damn cup of coffee. Not too sweet like some places, just the right hint of caramel syrup, clean creamy coffee goodness. And they always put a pretty design on the foam.  These people know what they are doing and you cannot go wrong getting a cup of any type of coffee here. Plus, they carry Rockstar bagels and some really good other pastries and the like. EVERYONE I have ever met is awesome and friendly and I've had some really cool conversations while waiting for my coffee. Favorite coffee shop. Wish they had one up North by where I live. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 5/1/2016 We have been big fans of Caffe Medici since they opened on West Lynn in '06. Although we've tried many other beans we always come back to the Medici Blend aka La Familigia. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was this past Friday to find out Cuvee and Caffe Medici have parted ways and La Famiglia is no longer available. We took a small bag of their new beans, the Spyhouse Orion's Blend. Although the barista assured me the blend was similar to La Famiglia neither my husband nor I agree. It is nothing close and not nearly as good. We are both very disappointed that Caffe Medici's newest house beans are not going to be a staple at our house. We're now on the search for a good replacement. :( ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 3/22/2015 Great single origin coffee from many places, try a new one everytime you go. The servers are friendly and nice.

Caffe Medici ," 1/4/2015 My husband and I decided to check out this place based on previous yelp reviews. We recently returned from Italy and it completely ruined us for drinking coffee out. I had high hopes for Caffe Medici because a friend had also told me she thought it was the best place in Austin.  The baristas did not disappoint. The place was packed and you could tell the orders were coming in as fast as those ladies could fill them, however, even being that swamped, they still took the time to make sure the quality of the drink was not compromised. In addition, they took the time to put some beautiful latte art on the drinks.  I ordered a cappuccino and my husband got a latte. I took my first sip and holy crap, it was strong and smooth! Yes! And just like that I found a little piece of Italy here in Austin, Texas. Thank you Caffee Medici. I'll be back! ", pos

I ordered a skinny vanilla latte with honey and the man taking my order was like, ""the honey is over there."" I'm thinking to myself, ""but the honey needs to go with the espresso before it's mixed with the milk so that it can melt..."" Anyways, not wanting to be much of a nag I just got the honey and waited. The barista was very sweet. Put the honey in for me but unfortunately they put the espresso right into the milk and the honey ended up along the sides of my cup. Also, the coffee tasted kind of uncomfortably creamy/milky. Not positive they used skim milk. Altogether, will probably frequent other coffee shops before returning here. ", neutral

I don't really see the need for five stars because the coffee is pretty average and the treats are a bit a lacking in variety. It would also be nice if they had some additional non-coffee options.

Caffe Medici ," 1/22/2012 Updated review Listed in Keep Austin Caffeinated I wanted to write a funny review about Cafe Medici, but, unfortunately, there is nothing funny about espresso. This is serious espresso made by serious baristas.  You think I'm kidding? Well, you try drinking a bottle of wine after a long day in a cubicle. Then, have your young children wake you up at 6:30 a.m. Guess what? They don't care about hangovers. All they care about is chocolate milk and Iron Man.  It's not pretty, folks. Orange juice won't cut through the fog. English breakfast tea won't drive away that headache and give you a fighting chance.  Sure, you could pop into your neighborhood Starbucks and have some middling coffee made by people more interested in blasting out Caramel Mocha-Fattacinos and upselling freaking Via to keep the a-holes in Corporate off their backs.  Why not come out firing? Take your life back. Go to Cafe Medici, somehow park in that ludicrously small lot, and order some seriously good espresso made by someone who knows more about coffee than any sane person should. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 3/10/2015 Best coffee + vibes in Austin. Their treats are really classy too. Everyone there is nice and its usually pretty good for reading or hamming around with a friend. When its raining or cold, it can get crowded, since the outside seating is not an option. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/1/2015 Great coffee, pricing comparable to other coffee shops. They were packed on the Saturday afternoon I was there, so it's not completely fair to evaluate the wait time I had for my coffee. I'll eat there and reevaluate later. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 6/25/2013 1 check-in Don't know if it's like this all the time but for what I came to do today, Caffe Medici is hitting the spot.  Before I get down to the nitty-gritty, here's my frame of reference and some context: it's a Wednesday and I came with the intent to write on my laptop with minimal need for wifi. Time spent spanned late morning and early afternoon.  Great location - neither at a crossroads nor in no man's land.  Music is non-obtrusive (not too loud, no emo. Think pre-Jack Johnson Jack Johnson, Hawaii jam band without the jam, margaritaville without the margaritas...) Customers are self-contained and quiet.  Space - perfectly middle-of-the-road, nonextreme in size and neither empty nor overcrowded. There were several open spots when I got there, all readily accessible. I chose the last open two-top at the front and sat on the bench under the window, which provides seating for two other two-tops. Though both tables were occupied by patrons who also sat bench-side, there was still ample space for both me and my stuff to fit on the bench alongside them. To boot, where I sat at the end closest to the corner, I was able to plug in to charge without a hitch.  Staff is super nice. when I got here a little before noon, when they were about to get rid of the remaining breakfast tacos and they threw me two on the house. For this I'd give the place 6 stars if I could.  Overall, I'd recommend this place for caffeinated independent work, whether it be laptop or reading. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/19/2013 Parking is a problem but the damn good drinks are worth it.  I love the small house and the tucked away feeling you get when you sit in the corner.  The baristas are friendly, fast, and make a gorgoeus drink.  Bring your pup and sit on the front porch or bring a good book (you know, the paper that's bound and has words) and enjoy the upscale homey feel of the inside. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/7/2014 This place is definitely my favorite branch out of the three caffe medicis in Austin. I love how cozy it is and how it is in a semi-residential neighborhood. It's a great place to get some work done because it doesn't get too loud. There is a lot of foot traffic on the weekends and it's pretty hard to get a table so you have to stake out for a bit, but the coffee makes it all worth it. I always get their cappuccinos! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 10/20/2014 Great atmosphere, fantastic coffee, Taco deli breakfast tacos, local pastries, good music.  I can't really say anything bad about Cafe Medici! Love this place. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/19/2011 Listed in Austin Awesome little neighborhood coffee shop that's frequented by the locals, including  a good coffee-drinking friend of mine.  I'm not a coffee drinker but I love the smell of coffee wafting throughout that shop.  You definitely gotta try their sausage rolls!  Just pure goodness! It goes great with a glass bottle of Coke.  Also, if you're in the mood for a breakfast taco or two, be sure to get there early in the morning cuz they sell out fast!  I definitely love the outdoor seating and tables made out of large rocks.  The staff were friendly.  Got to meet the owner and his family.  They're just an adorable family!  Want to feel belonged?  You'll definitely feel welcomed here! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 4/25/2014 1 check-in Cool atmosphere in a cute/retro part of town. Good luck finding parking though. There are 3 (maybe 4 if you have a smart car) tiny parking spots behind the cafe. All other surrounding parking is associated with other businesses & brandishes towing signs, so just meander into the neighborhood. At least the houses there are fun to see. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 11/14/2014 1 check-in Very nice place. Limited parking indeed (maybe 10 spots total), but it was worth finding parking on the street. The Cappuccino was delicious! excellent brew. The atmosphere was airy and plenty of natural light. There are small two-seater tables scattered, a couch with a bench, and some outside seating. Overall, a great shop. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 9/3/2013 Friendly coffee spot, great location and good coffee.  I've been on a quest to find a decent passable flat white in Austin. The folks at Caffe Medici knocked it out of the park.  Highly recommended. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/6/2011 Because I love coffee and everything about it, I've set out on an unofficial quest to try every coffee house in Austin and the surrounding area.  I finally tried Caffé Medici. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I'm kind of picky about my coffee and I am not easily influenced by what others say, however, my taste buds say this place really lives up to its reputation.  The lattes are smooth and bold at the same time - bold enough to grow hair on your chest if you get your coffee full on leaded. (I sometimes like to order de-caf....of the ""why bother"" variety).  If you don't want milk in your latte, they offer soy as an alternative. They swirl lovely art on top of the lattes for you. The lattes are prepared quickly. They also happen to offer pre-packaged gluten-free cookies in their pastry case, which I didn't try on this visit.  It's an old house. There are unique seats out front made of stone with wood planks drilled in. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is nice. You can find a bookshelf with books, magazines and games, or you can enjoy burying yourself in your laptop.....a little something for everyone it seems.  Cool place, great coffee. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/15/2015 The coffee here is insatiable. Two locations that I am aware of in Austin, but the West Lynn is my preference. ", pos 
Caffe Medici , 9/6/2014 Updated review Got almond milk! Coffee is awesome and dp now taco deli.  Yummy.  My only gripe is parking.  Otherwise super cool and nice employees. , pos 
Caffe Medici ," 5/27/2013 1 check-in Yeah yeah so I speak Starbucks and was schooled on what a real macchiato actually was. (Not the cold iced Caramel deliciousness that one might think)  So I was instructed that what I  actually wanted was an iced latte with Caramel. I was informed that the Caramel was made in house. I tasted little to NO Caramel in my drink. So I can not comment on how the Caramel actually was. They don't drizzle it in the glass or on top.  It was pretty good but not better than my beloved chain.  We ordered two of these beverages along with 2 chocolate croissants for a whopping total of $16. SAY WHAT?!  I don't live in ATX so I might not be back to this place.  Our Barista was really nice, I was just always feel so uncool whenever I go into a coffee shop in Austin. They have a way of making you feel so ignorant. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 12/13/2010 PARKING SUCKS!!  You have been warned.  They share a VERY small parking lot with the laundry mat next door and other places around the coffee shop have ""No Coffeshop Parking Allowed"" - so if you go good luck trying to find a place to park and hope you don't get towed which thank goodness didn't happen to me or anyone in my meetup group.  Only reason I gave them 3 stars is because the prices are affordable and the coffee and peanut butter cookie were good but other than that this place would have gotten 2 stars.  This place is not good for groups in less you are with a knitty group and only have like 4 people with you.  Some of the staff members were nice but the one making the coffee was a tad bit ""grumpy and crabby"" and should have stayed home.  I don't plan on ever returning - sorry Caffe Medici!! ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 6/27/2013 Probably my favorite Medici location.  Smaller, cozier, and really laid back. Love the location in Clarksville, and I appreciate the ""neighborhood café"" feel that you get here.  The baristas are great about remembering your name and they're always really friendly. A lot of Austin baristas can be really pretentious and/or standoffish. Anywhere with amiable baristas is a breath of fresh air in the ATX specialty coffee scene.  Coffee is quality here, and that quality is consistent. Medici (all 3 locations) does an excellent job training their staff to deliver excellent espresso beverages over and over again. If you're looking for traditional espresso beverages, this is a great place to go. Some of the best in Austin!  It can get a little crowded here, and parking can be hard to find in the small lot. If the lot is full, be prepared to park across the road, or in the neighborhood just east of the shop. During busy times, you might have to wait for a table, or look outside. There are some great tables in front of the shop, but they are usually in direct sun, and can be unpleasant in the Texas heat. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 3/6/2013 Drinks good. Baristas chill. My only suggestion is that the wall decor is pretty sparse. For Westlynn, I'd expect more liberal use of the wall space...  It'd be nice to read/see a bit more of the history of the building or of the Medici business.  Yes, there is photography posted, but there is a lot of blank canvas space with the walls, why not use the space to tell me a story?  Just a thought--people clearly come for the coffee, but they'd come back for a connection, so why not create it whenever and wherever possible? ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 6/27/2014 The coffee here was not to my taste. The cafe au lait came at an excellent temperature,  but I like my coffee slightly stronger-- too bland. ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 8/30/2014 After coming here a number of times, I figured it was time to finally review this place. Of the two Medici locations I've been to in Austin, I like this one the most. It's some sort of refurbished home in a small, residential area. They tend to be crowded inside but only because it is a small place. To counter that, they have neat stone chairs outside that are always available. I've never had a bad drink here and have never had any issue with the staff, though I also never order anything particularly fancy or difficult. Can't review the food since I've never eaten it. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 7/7/2014 1 check-in Coffee is awesome, the breakfast tacos are OK.  I've had their mocha latte, soy cappuccino, and iced coffee. All drinks were fantastic.  I came here for some food and was not impressed. Besides the fact that the tin foil wrapped taco almost gave me a 3rd degree burn (they must keep these hot over boiling water or something like that), when I finally opened it the taco was kind of congealed. The flavor wasn't bad but I wouldn't order one again.  Go here for coffee, not breakfast, and you can't go wrong! ", neutral 
Caffe Medici ," 5/30/2014 This is definitely my favorite place in Austin to grab some coffee. Great atmosphere and superb coffee, perfect for quick business meetings and perhaps a first date :) I highly recommend it! ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 1/14/2013 My sister has evolved into a coffee aficionado.  I mean, she has spent many years in Austria, travelled and lived all throughout Europe and has this 900 dollar espresso machine at home that she and her husband make coffee from.  When she talks about drinking coffee, she uses a vocabulary that lets you know she has drunk a lot of coffee in her time.    Before she became so good at knowing great coffee, I brought her to Caffe Medici and she fell in love with it.  This was about 6-7 years ago.  Last year, after she was talking about more of her coffee drinking exploits, I asked her where Caffe Medici now ranks in her global experience of drinking coffee.  She said, ""Hmm, that's a tough question.  I think I still have to either put them at the top or at least the top 2-3 coffee shops I've ever been to.  My mom also likes to drink coffee.  She is this crotchedy ol' woman who can lose her temper quickly.  She visited my house from Florida one day and was upset when she woke up and realized I didn't have any coffee.  ""TAKE ME TO STARBUCKS!"", she bellowed out.  So, we loaded up in the car and headed out.    However, I wasn't taking her to Starbucks.  Since there is a Starbucks on every corner, she soon grew weary of our journey and so sweetly said, ""Where in the Hell are you taking me!"".  I told her that I was taking her to the best coffee shop in Austin to which she started ranting about leaving her alone and simply letting her drink the same Starbucks coffee she has drunk all these years.  ""What are you doing?  This is ridiculous! "", she continued on.    By the time we got in line to order (the Clarksville location), her demeanor reflected a mix of frustration at not getting her Starbucks as well as withdrawls from not having any coffee at all in her system.  She orders the Hunapu, straight black and we sat down so she could have a drink.  The last thing I remember her saying was,  ""I just wanted my Starbucks coffee and you bring me all the way down here to this house....Sip (Pause)...Oh damn, this is good"".  Mark ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 2/19/2010 1 check-in Italian sodas, great kitsch and sugarcane coca cola.  Folks here are really friendly  -- looks like its more of the working crowd and the casual conversations happen pretty organically from one table to another.    Great wifi, with adequate pluggage and a great use of the space.  I wish they had delicious diet coke but their coffee selection looked extensive and I think they've got the mix down right on non coffee to coffee drink ration. ", pos

Caffe Medici ," 8/4/2012 Caffe Medici makes real coffee. Drip, french press, espresso (not ex-pres-o) etc....  I love the macchiato's. I'm not talking about Starbucks version either because that's a joke. This is as it should be, was made to be and is done correctly at Medici. Two shots, a small amount of milk and some foam. Quick fast in a hurry and out the door. That's how I do it at Medici. Mostly because there is no seating and everyone is camped out bumming the free wifi. Really? It's Clarksville I know you people can afford the internet.  Oh and watch your step here. What is it with people always spilling their water? I swear I've seen it happen more times that not at this location. I guess its the caffeine or lack there of jitters. ", pos 
Caffe Medici ," 10/11/2012 I have a fancy-assed very expensive Italian espresso machine at home with a fancy-assed burr grinder. I buy fancy-assed whole coffee beans, or sometimes roast them myself.  I rarely go out for coffee.  But if I have to, this is the only place I will go. The coffee tastes like real coffee, real espresso, real cappucinos... and by real I mean not some corporate-quality-controlled-likely with additives-starf*cks coffee. It's comparable to good coffee in San Francisco or Seattle.  If you've been afraid of real espresso for fear it will be bitter, sour or just unpalatable, try it here.  The parking can suck.I've never tried the food. They have water bowls for your doggies.  Some staff are nice; some seem to have Asperger's. I see complaints about lack of comfy chairs, but I go for the coffee, not the chairs (profound, huh?)  They will serve you in a real cup too. That's a weird statement, but I'm tired of getting paper/throw-away take out cups when I want to sit and linger with a good cup. I feel like I'm a McDonald's when I get served coffee in a paper cup.

Caffe Medici ," 12/29/2013 1 check-in Listed in Coffee Shop Adventure Cute little craftsman house, which adds to the ambiance.  Location is close to downtown but without the horrible parking issues... Just normal parking shortage, as is common for most trendy urban haunts. The espresso was a little bitter to me, but not burnt tasting. Day-old pastries  (from Quacks!!) are $1.   I put off coming here because every time I search for coffee an ad pops up, which seems to defeat the purpose of Yelp reviews & makes me wonder why they lean on advertising vs. word of mouth.  You can get real food, and they have all of the random not-cow milks.seems like a better place to meet a friend to chat than find a comfy spot to hang out. ", pos

Thank you!  I stopped by this place on the way back from a run in the morning. I had two things on my agenda - get some coffee and pick up a cute souvenir to bring back home.. this place had both! The gentleman who worked there was so nice and gave me recommendations on what I should bring home. Plus, the check-in offer let me get a free coffee with my purchase!  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for coffee or little trinkets/knick knacks to bring back.

Among the souvenirs I bought were jalapeño peanut brittle and some Austiniana, as well as notecards by the Art from the Street project.

Holy Grounds ," 2/16/2015 1 check-in Listed in More than 100 in 2015! So, a couple of things to start out with.  First, the location on the Yelp map was incorrect -- it sent me to South Congress St., which couldn't have been further from the actual location.  Secondly, you really have to dig into the reviews to see that it's actually inside the church (and not visible at all from the street). Kinda frustrating, but not their fault at all.  The cafe and little shop were really cute, with super affordable coffees (local, I believe), and breakfast treats. There was a bookstore, too, but I didn't have enough time to try it out.  It's a great little spot and much, MUCH cheaper (and better-tasting) than the Starbucks at the Hilton or the coffee stand inside the Convention Center. Definitely worth stopping by! I had the Starling roast, which was superb. ", pos

I would never have stumbled upon this place if I didn't know it was there, and what a shame for the average wanderer! Holy Grounds has: amazing music, a wide selection of books to read and purchase while sipping coffee, Tacodeli tacos, cozy chairs to curl up in, and most exciting for me, a Labyrinth Meditation Garden!!!! Walk down the stairs outside the church and you'll find yourself in a beautiful ivy-covered terrace. Follow the winding brick pathway and you'll find yourself in a new state of mind, observant, tranquil, content. The baristas are so sweet, the coffee and food everything I could ask for and maybe the best part is that it is so hidden, a place undiscovered by many and therefore so much more appreciated by those lucky enough to get to stop in here.

I highly suggest just a plain latte. The coffee is delicious and they also have a gift shop with some cute items.  Note--this is inside of St. David's church. You enter on the north end of the church.  Also, they have a $5 card minimum, but you can also create an account and they charge your total purchases on the 1st of every month. ", pos 
Holy Grounds ," 7/10/2012 23 check-ins First to Review Where can you drink fair trade coffee, eat Rockstar bagels and Kakawa chocolate covered cocoa beans, shop for hand blown glass with a low carbon footprint, browse Haitian wall art made from recycled oil drums, and pick up a copy of The Book of Common Prayer, too? If you replied: ""A south Austin hipster's apartment with a particularly random Anglican slant"", the judge's would say you were correct. But the answer we were looking for was ""Holy Grounds"", the coffee shop/bookstore located inside Austin's own St. David's Episcopal Church.  Whenever I have a conversation about the added perks that come with attending a downtown church, the fact that we have both Cafe Divine and Holy Grounds inevitably comes up. It's wonderful to have a built-in coffee shop for those times before or after service, or the days you find yourself at the church early during the week. Actually, it's where I say I'm ""going to go split a bagel with Jesus"".  It's also convenient to have an entire treasure trove of books to browse and purchase, especially if one will be used for a Journey Group, or a friend has recommended one for you to check out. As expected, many of the major Anglican/Episcopalian writers can be found, but among those with more general Christian topics and philosophy.  I think what people also need to know is that Holy Grounds is open to the public. This is definitely a new place to try if you work downtown in the area, as this may be a surprisingly close locale to grab some coffee or a snack. My personal favorite is a basic iced latte, but I am definitely interested in trying a Mayan Mocha, which they list as a customer favorite. Also, it's located in a church, so...you're kind of guaranteed friendly service from the baristas.  Speaking of service, in the recent past I had been scouring the entire city (including the Episcopal seminary) to try and find an Episcopal shield bumper sticker for my car. It costs less than a dollar, and to me should have been everywhere, but for some reason I couldn't find it online for the life of me, and I was told that the bookstore had stopped ordering this particular style. I left my name and number in case they ever came across one.  I had all but forgotten this request, when, months later, they received a shipment and someone called to tell me that my sticker was in. I couldn't believe it. Like I said, even *I* had forgotten about it, so it was remarkable they had remembered and had called me.  I'm notoriously unlucky with greeting cards, but Holy Grounds has a wide assortment to choose from by local artists Michael H. McKann and Ben Sargent. Naturally, it's easy to find cards for religious occasions such as baptisms, marriages, etc.  Along with Bibles and prayer books, this is the first place in town I've ever seen Anglican prayer beads for sale. Handmade by the Austin company ""Fiber Figments"", I have my eye on them, although I need to learn exactly how to pray them first before I actually purchase one.  In short: from breakfast tacos to quiche, candles to cards, Bibles to blown glass...Holy Grounds has it all.  Episcopalians with a passion for locally-sourced Austin goods? Now THAT's a real blessing!  5 Stars. Mayan Mocha ", pos 
Holy Grounds ," 7/13/2014 Tricky to find, located in an active church.  As you enter there are friendly greeters at a concierge desk,  the Holy Ground is  on the left in the gift shop.

I've been going here since it opened and my visits have slowed down significantly - the coffee has been meh the last few times.  I never used to get americanos (iced). I've never been a fan of the taste and end up overloading it with sugar. But Figure 8 has been the only place in the history of my life that can make an amazing americano and really capture the essence and notes of the roast - no anything else needed.  I'm so sad that it's just not as tasty...as the owners passed the torch to the baristas they've hired, I've just not really liked the coffee. I really really liked this place a lot...

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 6/29/2016 4 check-ins Figure 8 is an easy walk away from my humble little abode.  It's always bustling and draws a pretty good cross section of people. The inside is spacious enough and has an ample amount of tables for you to sit at.  It's impeccably decorated and has a really great energy about it. While parking isn't one that lends itself to its own private lot----there's plenty of street parking a hop skip and a jump away.  The coffee is pretty decent! I haven't had a cup that's made me make any undue faces yet. And they manage to make cappuccino art when I order with almond milk....which is impressive. :)  The only downside is that the folks working the counter are so friendly...that sometimes they get caught up in conversations with everyone around them....that you can be left standing at the counter, ignored----consciously-----for a couple of minutes. If you're not easily perturbed by this, then it won't faze you. But if you expect decent customer service in Austin (really----at this point, why is this still an expectation of yours?)---then you just roll with it and bat your pretty eyelashes at one of them till they wrap up their conversation.

Super cute, great ambience, not too noisy or too quiet, perfect atmosphere to hang out with friends or just study by yourself. Their interior design is really inviting and warm and with lots of sunlight---wayyy different than something like Epoch or Bennu's, which is usually darker, and more bright like Thunderbird's. Also, it wasn't even that busy on a Saturday afternoon though I think there was a small rush around 4 pm--but I definitely found myself an empty table. Not sure if they're super well-known yet, which might be why, but I wouldn't be surprised to find it super crowded in a few months (the way Thunderbird's is). There aren't many outlets, so I guess that might be the trickier thing.  Parking wasn't terrible--it is street parking, but I found quite a number of empty spots across the street and down the neighborhood. So it is doable.  The baristas were both really friendly though I didn't partake in any conversation with them. They went out of their way to hand me my coffee at the table and pick it up when I was done, which usually almost never occurs at other coffee shops.  Their coffee was GREAT.

I ordered an iced vanilla latte.  There is a lot of parking in the neighborhood, at least when we went, so that wasn't an issue, though the parking ""lot"" holds only three cars at a time. We came right before the rush, around 2pm so finding seating was pretty easy as well. The ambiance is nice, the music is non-intimidating and at an appropriate volume, and the decor is pleasing to the eye and minimalist, embodying the Austin spirit pretty well.  On the flip side, the beverages were solid, but not extraordinary. There are better options in Austin at a similar price point. We were quite disappointed after having read the raving reviews by other Yelpers. The tables are quite small, and the seating options are quite uncomfortable but manageable and sufficient in quantity [Quoting my friend: ""My butt hurts, so....""]. The wifi is a little slow, and the temperature is a little uncomfortable, slightly warmer than preferred. The bathroom smells a little funky, but it's not a big deal.

It is simple, crisply decorated and cozy, well thought out in a calm unpretentious way. I get a cup of their pour-over, which is done by the cup and by hand personally. It does not turn out to be the perfect cup, but that is not the important part. I decide 3/4 through the cup, with some light encouragement, to go and ask the staff about their brew process. I am my usual polite but very direct self. Instead of eye rolling and huffy hipster agitation at my gall and total lack of coolness, the gentelman at the bar pleasantly engages me in a brisk talk on the nuances of high end coffee brewing, and after a few min of chatter, Identifies correctly what my issue may be in the flavor profile of what I got, and asks if he can make me a different brew. He presides over the pour himself, and when it arrives it is EXACTLY the kind of coffee that I prefer and enjoy. This is not a very likely outcome, at all, The coffee has notes of ginger, citrus, molasses and malt, (I took notes) and a round, warm character totally unlike the sharp leading note of the first cup.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 10/24/2015 So I'm in Figure 8 pretty much every day. If I'm not studying here, I'm passing through to get a coffee before heading to school.  1. The coffee is excellent. They cycle their espresso every few days, and if you ask the baristas which one you should get, they'll help you to figure that out. One is usually a more tangy espresso, while the other is less acidic.  2. This is a really chill place to study. They're always playing good music, the people that come here are great and most people are here to either read or do work. The only slight downside is that sometimes it gets hot inside and the AC doesn't quite overcome the heat, but that's when it's 95+ outside, and that isn't Figure 8's fault, it's just that Texas weather.  3. The baristas are all awesome. None of them have an edge or are snobby in the slightest (as can happen in some coffee shops).

It's currently roasting a coffee called Tweed which comes from the Houndstooth coffee family but the cool thing about Figure 8 is a plan to continuously rotate beans from all over the US.

They also serve Steeping Room tea if you prefer that over coffee.    Parking is street parking.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 10/12/2014 1 check-in Small, intimate coffee house which the owners care about the process of coffee/espresso. I usually drink just coffee and none of the fancy stuff. The pastries were good. I sat at the bar while working on my assignment for class. There's a mirror wall, a table with a plant divider, good coffee and free WiFi. It's only been opened for two months.  Just a few notes - not many outlets and parking can be tricky. Too bad they can't be opened late though but I like Figure 8 and definitely a place to try out when you are in the area. ", pos

They have different varieties of coffee and although the cups are smaller than your regular mainstream coffee places, the price/quality ratio is really good. The ambiance was good and even though parking can be a bit difficult it is worth it! The one thing that is that the barista lady seem a bit distracted... Coffee is a serious business, so no room for distractions! ;) Overall, really good!!! ", pos 
Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 4/18/2015 I've had dozens of cortados since they started popping up around Dallas coffee shops in the last few years. I love them...and Dallas has an increasingly large number of higher quality, third wave coffee shops (Davis St Espresso, Ascension, etc.). But Figure 8's cortado seemed like an instant winner for my own personal 'Best Cortado of All Time' award.  Many times they have a bitter aftertaste, but Figure 8's managed to be incredibly smooth (so damn smooth) yet strong and robust.  Also, a very unique, understated decor and atmosphere. I told the Barista (Chris?) it was the best cortado, and he was gracious and friendly. ", pos

Beautiful aloof plant placement, white tiles, wood counters, a hint of throwback glint. I mean, my cool quotient shot up just sitting there.  Lots of seating for people working or just meeting. Some outdoor seating out front too. Very interesting converted house feel in an offbeat part of town.  We got the cold brew and it was delightful, strong and perfect for an 80 degree spring day. I wanted to go back again the next day. Nay, I wanted to move in. But I will have to wait for my next trip back to Austin.  ps. this is the perfect place to escape SXSW madness. ", pos 
Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 2/27/2015 1 check-in This place is a gem in the inside! I'm giving it 3 stars because they were lacking on snacks, which I always like to have as an option. When I went there was construction going on in the front (like they say, don't judge a book by its cover). The inside is very modern and light. The white walls and natural light coming from the windows don't make you feel like it's night outside at 4 pm. The baristas are friendly and their coffee is great. There's a big room to the left with tons of little tables to do work or hang out. I'd say this is an above average coffee shop, definitely check it out if you can. ", neutral

The space is small but comfortable, and they're in the process of putting in an addition for more space, so that's cool.  I will absolutely be back.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 10/20/2014 Austin isn't short of quality coffee shops. So what makes Figure 8 5-star worthy?  Delicious coffee. I had an iced latte, and it was excellent. The espresso was rich, smooth, flavorful, and not sour. It's all I've had so far, but it already rivals some of the best I've tried in Austin. Apparently they roast Houndstooth's Tweed coffee roasters, as well as rotating other local roasters. I don't claim to be a coffee expert, but I can tell you Tweed just tastes good.  Inviting atmosphere. The shop is small, but not tiny. The feel is unique - think ""Happy Industrial Garden."" Similar to a happier, younger sibling of Wright Bros. Brew & Brew. Metal chairs and stools surround rugged wooden tables. White-painted brick meets exposed, painted rafters, concrete floors, and vintage light fixtures. The vibe is bright and cheerful, designed to invite natural light that complements the large mirror wall and ample greenery (a really nice touch). Two vintage Sony speakers flank an antique mirror above the coffee bar. Figure 8 has a happy interior, and I much prefer that to dark-and-cave-like (especially during the day).  Friendly staff. Ryan and Kathleen are kind, inviting, cheerful, chill, and knowledgable. They know their stuff, but there isn't an ounce of presumption in their work. They're the kind of people that make you happy to buy their product, and then come back again. ", pos

This place as made me a believer in Tweed. They also have a lovely pastry selection that includes vegan options!  I love the ambience and light the room gets in the early mornings. It's such a romantic shop. I typically don't use coffee shops as an office/workspace and really enjoy just having coffee and a good conversation.

Figure 8 Coffee Purveyors ," 9/24/2014 Product: The product is on point. I can tell they take pride in making sure every single drink is made to the best of their ability with delightful presentation, which to me is what puts the ""craft"" in craft anything. They are constantly adjusting the grind to make sure it's dialed in and so far it has been perfectly consistent, and consistency is one of the most important things to me for any business. As for food, the pastries they carry are ok but damn, their tacos are delicious! I love Taco Deli tacos, like a lot, but the one's at F8 are actually better and bigger.  Atmosphere: Proper and DIY. I love when I can walk into a place and it immediately hits me with a good vibe. Then when I take a moment to sit and notice small details and decor that I can tell were done with good taste and style on a small budget. That, to me, is so much cooler than walking into a place and it looks like they just sunk a hundred grand into it to impress but it feels stale and contemporary.  Service: So far, so good. I consistently am greeted with a smile, and consistently am asked about my day. No one has ever tried to sell me more than I've asked for. Of course they are both easy on the eyes and new business owners but I don't get a pretentious vibe from either of them. And as far as I know they both grew up in Austin and have been working in coffee shops and bars/restaurants on the east side for many years, which means they have easily earned their place on Chicon.  Complaint: Not enough Figure 8's in town :( ", pos

The body of the coffee and taste is just spectacular. I had mine iced with almond milk and just about everything was incredible. From the size to temperature to amount of ice, you name it. The perfect coffee. They also have Kouign Amann which is one of my favorite pastries. It's like a very sweet French croissant with a crown shape. It reminds me of Argentinian medialunas!

Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 9/27/2016 1 check-in I came by here in a party of 2 a little before 5 on a Saturday afternoon.  Parking: Parking anywhere near South Congress is a hassle, but we parked (for free) on a neighborhood street off West Monroe Street on the block adjacent to South Congress.  Atmosphere: The place is small. 4 chairs in the front as you walk in with a lot of natural light and room to put a laptop or so on the wall table. There is a longer table in the back with space for 6-8 people, and I believe there were two other small 2-person tables for chatting. There are also 3 bar stool like chairs to sit on that look into the workspace. My friend said the back terrace area is usually available as well but was not available due to a wedding reception. I'm not sure if it was just because of the reception, but my friend and I were forced to sit on the bar stools for a couple minutes before we sat near the door after a girl left. Definitely a cutesy cafe though.  Food/drink: I ordered a nitro-cold brew and enjoyed it! I think I would still prefer a regular cold brew if possible, but it wasn't bad.  Service (and some food): My cold brew (which was pre-brewed) didn't come out for like 10 minutes, so after I asked about it, the worker was super apologetic and let my friend and I get a free pastry each on the house! (FYI their pastries are half off after 5 pm anyways). Both the pastries were just good, nothing spectacular but I liked that it was free. They also had water/sparkling water on tap as well.  The coffee was decent, environment was ideal for some chatting, and the service made a fantastic recovery after a mistake. Would like to come back again!! Nitro cold brew Pastries ", pos 
Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 5/10/2016 Manana is the newest coffee shop on South Congress. It's boho-chic vibe is great for insta pics and interior design therapy. It's honestly beautiful.  The coffee is good and the baristas are friendly. It's more of a destination coffee shop to sit at with a friend and catch up. The set up isn't conducive to working remotely, but that's what I like about it. It's the perfect spot to sit with a couple of pals and talk. Inside or outside, you can't go wrong - it's all lovely.

I loved the cortado... Just enough milk and sweetness. I like my coffee strong and not too sweet so the cortado with a splash of house syrup was spot on.. And the coffee art is the perfect touch.  The macarons are delicious and huge. I hate small macarons!! I loved the PB&J macaron! I'm just dreaming about it now and wish that I had bought more.

I think people also grab a coffee while in line for South Congress Cafe...  The flavored drinks here are very light, meaning the flavor doesn't overpower the espresso, a feature that is to my liking. Their lattes are just bitter enough for my tastes.

It's the perfect spot to post up and get some work done. The big windows remind you that there is in fact life outside of your laptop, and the Mexican tile and overall aesthetic make it the perfect place to keep you buoyant and happy!

Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 5/23/2016 My dad and I had a lengthy discussion recently about how Austin coffee shops have become snooty. Don't worry about that here, because Manana coffee ended up on our ""friendly baristas"" list.  We came in after dropping my car off down the road at Twomey Automotive (see previous Yelp Review- for best car body shop in town). I had been previously to the hotel for their cinco de mayo event, but after coming back realized how much they took out for the event (makes since drunk adults and expensive modern furniture don't mix).  Anyways, we were pleased to be surprised by our service at manana coffee. My cortado (first time getting one) even came served with a heart on top. The décor reminded us of our recent visit to San Antonio, it has that Southwest Texas meets Mexican vibe.  Seemed to be a mix of locals and tourists inside, but as a local we were excited to see this place doing so well on  South Congress. As Austin is booming with new businesses, i'm hoping this one stays- it's got class and good service. I can't wait to go back! ", pos

It's near the back of the open courtyard area, so it feels like a retreat away from the hustle and bustle of South Congress Road.  So far, their made-to-order drink menu consists only of coffees (which is fine by me) and not yet juices. They do have bottled Juiceland juices in the fridge though.  There's a good amount of pastries to choose from. The one I had was good. They apparently make them in-house. Impressive.  I'd come back to read a book...or the paper, if I did that sort of thing.

Mañana Coffee & Juice ," 7/17/2016 First of all, this place is beautiful. No surprise, since it's part of the South Congress Hotel! The whole place was bright, light and airy, and felt like a breath of fresh air after walking around in the heat. The tiled coffee counter is stunning and so picture-worthy if you're into that. The barista behind the register was super friendly - she actually seemed like she wanted to be there and that she genuinely wanted me to enjoy my experience, which is not always the case with overworked Austin baristas. I resisted the pastries in the case because I knew I didn't need one....but they looked amazing - not your typical coffeeshop pastries. I ordered an iced almond milk latte, like I do at every coffee shop I go to for the first time, and it was excellent. The almond milk was creamy and had a fresh taste with no weird after taste that sometimes comes with almond milk. It didn't overpower the espresso - I need to still be able to tell there is coffee in there, and this was perfect. My one complaint would be that I wish the size was a little bigger, but I'm guessing that it's high quality stuff and they would have to charge more for a bigger size - not a big enough deal to make me remove a star, especially because the ambiance was so wonderful! that tiled coffee bar ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 11/29/2016 1 check-in First time here to check out this place. It's a small coffee place a few miles from the hustle and bustle of the university. It was about 4:00 Sunday afternoon, and it was not too crowded. All the patrons seemed to be focused on what they were doing. The setting is causal and community-like, which is intentionally catered for nearby university folks. The ""bar"" part refers more to the setting than the fact they serve alcohol. They have long bar tables and chairs, along with a few regular wooden tables in the middle and some small sofa chairs against the inside wall.  We had a wintermoon latte with their much sought-after ""moon milk"". It was very smooth, sweet, and noticeably creamier than usual. We also got a mocha moon. It had all the good stuff of the latte, plus the chocolaty flavor.  If you're out of luck finding a spot inside, you can try the patio in the front. There are a few tables and a bar table on one side. It was from a raised deck with plenty of tree branches hanging over it. Nothing fancy, but it gives you a pleasant view of the traffic on 1st Street when you feel bored on what you're doing.  I have to say parking is no fun. We spotted a space in the parking lot behind the building, but it was a bit too small for our vehicle. We couldn't u-turn out and had to cautiously back our way out. We finally parked on a side street. It was a nice walk to the shop though.  Another thing is this place opens late till 12:00 midnight. So if you need a late night coffee, come on by!

I got the half moon latte as other reviewers have said the summer moon latte was too heavy and sweet. Half moon is delicious and perfectly made! It's creamy and has the right amount of sweetness. I'm not one for coffees that taste like a straight up milk shakes and I typically drink my coffee black. This drink definitely satisfied my sweet tooth craving.  The atmosphere is very ""austin"" and I was able to get work done. The noise volume wasn't bad and the music wasn't distracting. They have bar counters and a few tables for those who need more space. Really great place for coffee and studying!! Only down side is that parking is a little tricky. ", pos

If their goal is to provide you with a stellar coffee experience by simply delivering on the promise of great coffee- all I can say is well done. I hope I don't find out that one day the secret ingredient ""moonmilk"" which seemingly consists of a minimum of 9 different dairy milks- is some how laced with cocaine! I've never been addicted to a food or beverage before and I can honestly tell you that this was a first. The summer moon latte, 007 and Mocha Moon are all amazing.

Love how they have tacodeli breakfast tacos in the morning, too! I'm sure they sell out, but there has always been a decent taco selection in the mornings on the weekends when I've gone around 9-10am.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 3/15/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin, TX (ATX) I'm assuming there is crack in that moon milk because omg that (iced) wintermoon latte was delicious. Initially it was too sweet for me (if you're not a fan of sweetness, I'd get a half moon latte) but I think that once the ice started melting, the sweetness mellowed out.  I forgot to check what moon milk was exactly made out of, but it made the iced latte very rich and creamy. Definitely recommend!

I ordered an iced caramel latte (my go-to drink) but they don't have caramel here.  The barista recommended a half wintermoon because of the hint of caramel flavor mixed in with the vanilla ice cream. I decided to order a bacon, egg, and cheese hand pie too.  Both were so good. Wow. I wish I could have this hand our every morning for breakfast. It's fat, flaky, and filling. And no shortage of cheese (plus for that).  Coffee was good, the perfect amount of sweet for me. I've been decreasing my reliance in sugar in my coffee so thank goodness this wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.  Desk space is limited, with a bar-like type of set up in the middle for people to work in community style, side-by-side. It's interesting and not as uncomfortable as I thought it'd be. There are two good-sized tables so if you need a lot of workspace, try to snag one. The small tables and bar-top setup are OK if you want to just read or journal or something or if you have just a laptop and nothing else. I happened to bring some books with me for Bible study so this was perfect for me.  And I love that it's not too quiet and not too loud. Perfect noise level for working.

There was quite a line and most of the tables were full, which we took to be a good sign. Ordered an almond latte and a frozen hot chocolate. Both were very well made. We also decided to order a couple of breakfast items. The premade breakfast tacos were ok; not bad, just not anything to write home about. The handpie was delicious and decent size. Big fans of this one! The chocolate croissant was unfortunately not fresh so I didn't even finish it.  There's a small parking lot, but it was full when we pulled up so we parked on the side street. They have a small outdoor seating area, which was nice. I hesitated to give this café only 3 stars, but the service was so stand offish and rude. The guy working the register and taking our orders was probably the least friendly person we came into contact with in our 4 days in Austin.

With locations off of Burnet, S. 1st and Buda , they have graciously placed caffeine near my home, work and a best friend.  So very kind of them.  Try the summermoon, their signature drink.  It is basically a latte made with crack.  I mean, milk.  I mean, there might be crack in the milk.  Whatever they put in there, it is sweet and i start to itch if i don't have one every few days. If it is too sweet, try ordering it as a half- moon and they cut back on the sugary milk.  Also, you can get your moon milk made with almond milk for a non dairy option.  Try a bag of their house roasted coffee, it is stellar and has a slightly smokey taste from their wood burning oven.    Can we talk about the hand pies?  They are buttery, flaky and come in many flavors.  I suggest the chicken pot pie.  The new Burnet location also serves TacoDeli tacos.

Didn't see it on the menu but WOOHOO! He also said their coconut milk alternative was called the Beach Boys. Lol the other barriers wasn't familiar with the names so I think he just made them up but they should definitely think about adding it on the board.  SummerMoon/Tokyo was delicious! I felt like I was drinking milk tea cause it was so creamy and smooth. It was also the perfect level of sweet! I do like my coffee sweet but it wasn't TOO sweet. I got a 12 oz and I wish I got a bigger cup!  The interior was also super cute with a lot of single seats like a bar type tables. Seemed pretty calm and relaxed so I could see myself getting some work done but I'm not sure about it being a good study spot.  Tl;dr - try anything with moon milk!

I don't think going there at least 4 times a week and dreaming about it is a problem. A problem is if I would day dream about how to make my own Moon Milk - realize I will never unearth the recipe and accept the fact I will spend my life savings at Summer Moon. A problem would be buying a t-shirt from there hoping it would smell like Moon Milk and then I would never wash it. Ever. A problem would be buying a mug from there and hoping/wishing/praying that Moon Milk would magically appear in my bland coffee like some kind of Harry Potter voo doo.  Well since I do none of that I can just say that Summer Moon is amazing. The Moon Milk is one of a kind and made of unicorn tears. Just what I imagined unicorn tears to taste like.

My only complaint I have is that the service could be slow.  I took a friend here who was visiting and was craving local coffee shops and only ordered a latte with almond milk.  I swear it must have taken more than 10 minutes to get her coffee and we had to remind the staff that we were still waiting for hers.  Were they out of almond milk and ran to the store to get it?

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 12/30/2015 3 check-ins Listed in Om Noms Austin Props to Summermoon for making me able to drink my first cup (okay, 1/4 cup) of black coffee! Personally, I'm not too crazy about coffee and don't actually enjoy the taste of it most of the time and never (before Summermoon) could I drink it black. Plenty of milk and sugar is usually how I roll.  My first couple experiences here, I tried their variety of lattes which are made with infamous Moonmilk-- a sweetened milk spiced with a secret blend of spices and everything nice. The Summer Moon is super sweet, too much so even for me, so my favorite of all was their Half Moon (half as sweet as the Summer). Their Mocha Moon has a nice deeper flavor and wasn't too chocolatey. They also offer seasonal options like an Autumn Moon (pumpkin spiced) in the Fall and Peppermint Joy in the Winter all of which were delicious.  As for their drip coffee, I recently took one of my brothers here while we were touring around Austin and he's a purist when it comes to coffee. When he took his first sip, his eyes perked up and he said that it was really good so I decided that I would try it and I liked it a lot! I still prefer mine with cream and sugar though. I don't really know coffee enough to know what makes one cup better than another, but I believe my brother and all the other people who know coffee who are crazy about this place to know that there's something truly special here at Summermoon.

Like everywhere else that's popular in Austin, there's shitty parking and make sure you're prepared to stand in a line (unless you get there at 7 am on a weekday). Park on the street (in the correct direction if you're not a moron). And be prepared to listen to endless drivel from boring spoiled UT kids.  They recently re-did the menu boards, taking off the prices. I don't like that. That's sketchy AF. The prices went up. Don't let them fool you.  When it's hot as balls outside, drink the 1/2 wintermoon. It's not as sweet as the ""normal"" wintermoon, but it's still very sweet. Add an extra shot or four if you feel crazy.  Do yourself a favor and sit outside. It's cozy on that cute porch. They don't take orders from the window anymore, sadly, but that's okay! It's not that hard to get up and go stand in that line inside ;)  TLDR: drinks are great (GET THE HALF WINTERMOON, NOW). food is decent but nothing to write home about if you're a tourist. parking sucks.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 8/23/2016 First, their coffee is absolutely heaven in a cup. I'm not a huge fan of iced coffee or overly sweet drinks, so I always get the half moon latte. Words cannot describe what happens to your mouth or brain as you drink it. It's straight up ambrosia. I find myself laying up awake some nights thinking about that latte.  The reason that they lose a star is for ambiance. While it seems to be a great place to work, it's not really a place where I would ever meet a friend just for coffee and a chat. They have the straight-up dingiest fabric chairs along their back wall. I literally feel like I need to change my clothes after sitting on them. I'm not kidding - I would literally find it preferable to sit on the bare floor. Unfortunately, there's nowhere else inside to sit if you are just there for fun, and those dirty chairs are usually open. (I wonder why!)  If Summer Moon invested in swapping those terrible lounge chairs out, I would probably visit a lot more! In the end, their moon lattes are terrific, but seating not so much. ", pos

The comfy seating indoors was mostly taken, especially all of the couches. They had a lot of empty stools inside, but sitting on a stool for a few hours = back pain. We ended up finding two chairs right by the door. Although they have outdoor seating, it had just rained and everything was damp.  Summermoon gets great business. But that also means it gets loud and the inside has an overall cluttered feel to it. I prefer more of a calmer ambiance.    I'm not much of a coffee person, so I ordered the carrot apple smoothie and vegan pot pie. Both were good (although expensive). They also don't take Discover or American Express, so I had to pay with the limited cash I had on me.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 7/11/2016 Before I get into the details, if you're just skimming these reviews... Buy a HALF WINTER MOON LATTE (basically a semi-sweet ICED coffee). This is the drink to buy here.  Let me first preface... this 5 star review is based pretty much solely on the TASTE of the ICED COFFEE. I'm comparing based on yumminess relative to all other iced coffee varieties I've had. If you're looking for a standard cold brew with no additives, or if you want a well-lit work space, then this rating would be lower. The coffee is so good that I've decided to basically ignore the issues. I crave this coffee when I come home from being away.  Pros: - I have had pretty much every ice coffee / cold brew in Austin at this point, and the Half Winter Moon latte is as good as it gets. That said, if you don't like your coffee milky and a bit sweet then you likely have a very different measure for iced coffees - Line moves pretty quickly, tho it is generally long - Lots of cool swag that they switch out every few months it seems (I have several mugs and mason jars myself) - No other ""wood fired"" coffees in town that I know of. There's really not much else that tastes like it  Cons: - The parking is bad (but it's the same pretty much anywhere in Austin so I don't notice anymore) - The seating is limited and not very awesome (they used to have a much cooler set up that fit the aesthetic more, but the new counter has lots of outlets and fits more people) - No prices on the board, which they changed and is kinda weird ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 9/2/2015 3 check-ins Listed in comfy, cozy, & chill Hey friends, don't get me wrong, okay?! The ""secret 7-ingredient recipe"" moon milk is AMAZING. It tastes like coffee creamer on vanilla ice cream steroids. Always down for vanilla ice cream steroids. But in my Half Wintermoon (yup, I even got the half sugar option), it was a little too sweet. Like, ""the back of my throat hurts a little bit"" too sweet. For a rich, decadent drink - if I'm ever craving a caffeinated milkshake - I would come here in a heartbeat, but for a daily go-to coffee fix, I'd pass on the Wintermoon.  The chicken cordin bleu hand pie was DELICIOUS. Buttery, golden crust, and a creamy, flavorful chicken & cheese & ham filling. Loved it.  The place itself is pretty chill. I like the music! However, all of the table space is relatively small, aside from two larger square tables.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 5/8/2016 1 check-in The Half Moon is hands down the best latte I've had in Austin. I'm glad I opted for the Half Moon over the Summermoon as I found it to be the perfect amount of sweetness. The espresso was smooth, and left me with a real kick. The parking lot is small and the shop cozy, but it's worth it. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 5/23/2016 I love this place. We came here to enjoy a cup of cafe after a long day. I got plain drip coffee and the ""bae"" (as the kids say) got the half moon. Both of us were very VERY pleased with our choices. I even bought whole beans to make the sweet nectar from the gods at home.  If you like really sweet coffee go for the Summermoon. But neither of us can drink things that sweet so the half moon is perfect in our opinion.  Go here. You'll love it. I promise.  Four stars for no real mugs. I don't mind paper cups, but a trendy shop like this should offer mugs. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 9/10/2015 We liked the coffee at Summermoon but the store is nothing special. It's apparently a big college place as pretty much every seat was occupied by what appeared to be students working on laptops. It's a functional if not particularly comfortable place, mostly an assortment of desk-type chairs and Formica countertops and tables. There are a lot of power outlets.  I had an iced Americano. 3 shots of very good espresso in a 16 oz drink hit the spot! My wife ordered iced tea (don't recall the variety) but they were out. She got an iced coffee, instead. She said it was too strong for her but generally I'd say that's a good thing.  I bought some of their Ethiopian whole bean in-house roasted coffee to go. They do a nice medium roast, not the usual over roasted beans you get from a lot of places. Ethiopian coffees have nice floral tastes that really come out in Summermoon's roast. Well done!  Summermoon is a good place to drop in to grab a cup when you're on S 1st. ", neutral 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 8/7/2016 You guys. This coffee must have crack in it or something- I'm literally OBSESSED and ADDICTED! It really is so good. Sometimes the full ""summermoon latte"" is a little too sweet. Order the 3/4 Moon if you want that yummy moon milk, just less sugary! ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 6/12/2016 Summer Moon is without a doubt my favorite coffee shop in Austin! I have tried many coffee shops to compare, and honestly nothing comes close to the incredible coffee at Sumer Moon. The ""moon milk"" they put in some of their drinks is addicting in a very good way. If you are in the mood for a coffee drink that tastes like cake in a cup, try the Iced Wintermoon Latte. If you want something not as sweet but still delicious, try the Iced 1/2 Wintermoon Latte.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 2/3/2016 Bottom line- Coffee is great, servers/snacks are not.  I tried the half wintermoon latte, which was AMAZING. I wish I could go more often, but they don't open until 8, usually my work-time. I can imagine if you have a hankering for a sweet drink, the regular wintermoon/summermoon would be fantastic!  I also picked up a muffin, which ended up being the most vial thing I have ever tasted and was thrown away. Gluten free banana can be great, but this was not- drive, flavorless, dirt. That's alright though- I don't judge a coffee shop by their sweets.  The staff weren't friendly to me whatsoever. I was actually quite taken aback by how I was treated. So, a place I would go for coffee but not stay for coffee!  Overall, the coffee was perfect. I will go again and again and again, given the opportunity. I just don't expect anything from the baristas :) ", neutral

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 2/8/2016 Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge Summer Moon is this cute, little, eclectic, coffee bar right outside of downtown Austin.  It is as ""Austin"" as it gets.  Upon entering you immediately notice the array of different people from all different walks of life, hanging out, studying and just enjoying their awesome coffee.  I was first introduced to this wonderful place last summer.  I spent all day in hair and makeup, as two of my friends were getting married.  My husband, did not have to spend all day in hair and make up and got to run around town tasting all that Austin had to offer.  I'm not a coffee snob, but I do love it when my coffee doesn't get all acidic and sour and that was a huge plus. They wood-fire roast their coffee (I'm not even sure what it does exactly but it sounds fancy, and fancy always means delicious?) which makes them different than a lot of places.    However, it's that moon milk that makes this place.  It's so creamy and not overly sweet, but just all sorts of amazing.  I'm usually pretty good at replicating things that I taste, but I can't seem to get this right!  Unfortunately I live in Houston so Summer Moon has just become a place for me to visit whenever I go to Austin, but, that just means that I have to go to Austin more often now! (My poor wallet.)

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 2/8/2016 Summermoon...my second home, literally.  Moved here last May for physical therapy school and am here pretty much on a daily basis sometimes twice a day.  I'm a big coffee person and have had many to drink from many different states but who would've thought the best cup of coffee i would ever have in my life would come from my home state of Texas.  My go to drinks: -MOONTADO with an extra shot (has been my go to for the past month or so) -half moon latte when i'm feeling cold -half winter moon latte when i'm feeling hot -007 when i need a slight caffeine kick but don't want to be drinking a lot of liquid -moonraker when I need to be wired (regular moon lattes are sweeter)  Seating can be limited sometimes especially over the weekend but its a good place to study or do whatever if you can grab a seat.  Vibes are always great and each and every employee have been nothing but wonderful to me.    If you are visiting, please make this your first coffee stop as it will probably be the best life decision you have ever made. You'll probably see me there.  Toodles. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 5/1/2016 This is going to be an overly optimistic review. 4 stars IS generous, but warranted.  According to Belly, I have checked into this location 726 times since 04/2012. Shame on me for never writing a review.  I go to Summermoon for the great coffee and fantastic people.  Moonmilk is amazing. I've heard most of the rumors about what it is, but the baristas keep their lips tightly sealed about the exact recipe. The latest rumor is that it's melted down Amy's Mexican Vanilla ice cream (I hope that one is true).  The moonmilk mystery adds to the experience. It's complex flavor keeps you wondering what it is, but you don't know, so you sip more to try to know. It's close to a religious experience. Extreme, I know.  The staff are the best. I have a great relationship, as a regular, with each barista. Those behind the counter are hipsters. They'll remind you they're people and not only your order takers. Appreciate them because they're about serve you (probably) the best coffee you've ever had.  The rest of what you read in the reviews are true. The parking is difficult, the bathroom is outside and unclean, the coffee shop is small... on and on...  I don't know about you, but I go to a coffee shop FIRST for coffee. When I find something rare and unique like Summermoon, overcoming the hurdles is justifiable and don't take away from a positive rating. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 7/5/2015 5 check-ins Best cup of coffee I have EVER had!  I know this seems like a bold statement but let me assure you I have drank a lot of coffee in my 40 years on this planet. I have had a best cup of coffee experience once before about 15 years ago but it has been knocked off its throne by the Summermoon latte.  We were looking for a place to grab an evening coffee before what was going to be a late night in Austin. Found this place on yelp and headed to Summermoon.  When we first walked in I noted that this appeared to be your average little coffee shop with tables and chairs scattered about with people illuminated from the glow of their laptops. As I approached the coffee bar I was expecting to be greeted with the I'm too cool to help you attitude so common among baristas. I was shocked when the girl greeted me with an enthusiastic, ""Hey! How are you guys? Looks like you've been doing something fun. What are your plans for the 4th of July? That sounds so cool!"" Wait. What? A friendly barista can this be true? It is!!  I then looked over their menu. Settled on the Summermoon latte. It is a latte made with ""moon milk"". I have no idea what is in moon milk as that is a secret. It is milk with I believe 7 secret ingredients. What ever it is it is stinking DELICIOUS!!  My latte arrived quickly and was delivered by another equally friendly employee. Upon my first sip I knew I had discovered my perfect cup of coffee. I have been in Austin for 2 more days and I have awoken each morning wanting another cup. I won't be leaving here today without one!! ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 1/25/2016 The wood-fired coffee is super yummy. We always grab a bag to bring home to FL each time we come back to Austin. The Moon Milk is totally over the moon. I've got my suspicions as to what it is, but I won't be so unkind as to share my ideas (or their secrets).  The line is always long (which is fine, the coffee is good so I get it) but the service is super slow. It's as if like each employee is competing to prove which one of them cares less about costumers. Fortunately for the business owners, the quality of the coffee is worth forgiving the total lack of customer service. ", pos

We got the summer moon latte in the 20 oz. it comes with 3 shots but we got a 4th shot complimentary woot! They make their coffee with this special concoction called moon milk. Yes it tastes as deliciously mysterious as it sounds. It was described to us as a mixture of melted vanilla Icecream and toasted marshmallows. How can you go wrong with that? They also offer the half moon which is less sweet but I think the original tasted perfect just the way it is. A lot of coffee shops I go to is for the ambiance but I'll be coming back here for the delicious coffee. , pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 6/24/2016 This is one of those, ""five star reviews but I sure do have something to say."" I come here at least 1x a week. The MM is shamefully the bomb.com and the vibes are good. Heck I even had my first date with my current boyfriend here. Good networking. Love the spinach egg and cheese tacos. Parking blows but welcome to ATX. Get the Wintermoon (iced) or Summermoon (hot) latte and your life will be complete. Everyone is always smiling and happy, EXCEPT the crotchety cashier/barista. There is a dude man (haven't seen his sour face in a month or so), and particularly this petite brunette lady with lenses. I'm twice her size and still feel like she is going to spit fire or eat me alive if I don't order fast enough or if I waited in line 10 minutes to simply ask if you had any more bfast tacos left like it was a huge waste of HER time. Hi. Welcome to a cafe. We're the ones in a rush, not you. I'm a cashier myself, and know that once I clock in, I'm now a smiling ray of freakin sunshine no matter what. Welcome to adulthood where we suck it the hell up :-) It's a dark place but pays the bills.  I would never give this place a bad rating due to one poor employee. This place ROCKS. My only suggestions are: 1) teach her how to make a coffee and give her dark sunglasses 2) take a few minutes to create a quick sign you can stick up by the tacos to avoid customers waiting for one taco to find out (and possibly be stabbed) there are none left. 3) there are unfamiliar customers constantly walking up the outside ramp to see if the order window is indeed in play. Which it rarely is. I sit out here often & I just point them back inside. Again, all it takes is a friendly sign :-) ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 6/20/2015 1 check-in Listed in I enjoy beverages One random weekday night I seemed to find myself needing a place to work in south Austin. Hey! This place has wood fired coffee. Not sure what it means but it broke the tie between the abundance of Austin coffee shops.  Coffee: I had the regular drip wood fired and accidentally put too much half and half so it was realllly good. But I think it was also the coffee's fault. Yum!  Working: I easily found a spot with a plug for my laptop and I didn't feel cramped. This place doesn't hold a ton of people and I liked that. Less annoyance. I felt surprisingly comfortable here - I think because most everyone was working quietly for the few hours I was. Not a lot if chatty cathys or whatever.  Bathroom is in the hall. Cheat sheets on the tables for passwords. Nice place, I would return!!! ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 12/8/2014 104 check-ins Summermoon is my ultimate favorite coffee - in the world, hands down.  I am a religious customer and have been ever since I discovered this place several years ago. The Half Wintermoon with 4 shots of espresso is my drink of choice. It costs just as much as a drink from Starbucks but 10 times better (about $5 for a 20 ounce).  The Wintermoon alone is a little too creamy for me, although still delicious. I recently switched to regular coffee of the day (cheaper and warmer) with the famous secret 'Moon milk.' Moon milk is organic, sweet, and a curious buttery milk.  You still get that unique creamy taste you can't get anywhere else in Austin. The coffee is also the only wood fired coffee in Austin.  This place can get pretty full because it's a great place to study. I love taking a book or laptop here and hanging out for a couple hours. There are also breakfast tacos in the mornings I'd you get there earlier enough!  Parking in the front can get crowded, so try the back parking lot or side streets. ", pos

I came here to get a little work done and it was a fun break from the monotonous work from home life. The music was cool, plenty of outlets and chairs. The important part though is the coffee and drinks. Pretty freakin good. I don't really drink coffee or tea but I tried some and I was not disappointed at all. I would definitely come again.

I live in this neighborhood, but I'm about to move so I will definitely be missing this place. Although I'm not quite as much of a fan of their hot drinks (the cappuccinos are overly foamy), this is completely made up for by how great their iced drinks are. The moon milk is SOO good. Whatever the combination, it makes the best flavored latte I've ever had. I recommend the moonraker (if you can handle 4 shots of espresso) or the wintermoon latte. Staff is also very friendly and will remember your order if you come in a lot. I also like that they offer the Belly rewards points that add up to earn you a free shirt or drink. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 10/13/2015 I never stepped foot into Summermoon yet since I'm over a thousand miles away...but I've been feeding my addiction ordering their coffee beans online. Who knew the start of loyalty would stem from my friend bringing me back a bag of coffee beans to try from her recent trip to Austin?  --Velvet Blaze: Their signature bean! It's pretty well-rounded but probably the most oily, so I had to play around with the ratio of bean to water a bit. Very balanced flavor profile and low acidity. I'm a fan.  --Swinging Lantern: This consisted of 3 different roasts (light, medium, and dark). It's a unique concept, but it didn't work for me. There was an unfavorable cinnamon aftertaste from the light roast beans. I wouldn't get this again.  --Wild Fire: This is my favorite so far, but it's no surprise since Sumatra is my favorite type of bean. This will be a regular order for sure!  I still have a bag of En Fuego coffee beans to try. I'll revisit this review when I do :)  Pricing is very reasonable (almost a steal, really!): $12.95 per bag and free shipping if you order 3 or more bags. My current favorite coffee bean is sold only in-store at a shop in LA and this is priced at $22 per bag, but it doesn't have the complexity and hard work of a wood-fire roasted bean. Summermoon is now my main coffee source with its great quality roasts and reasonable prices! ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar , 5/2/2015 Mmmmmmm that moon milk is somethin delicious for a dessert coffee.  If you don't have a sweet tooth maybe just try the half moon milk with your coffee.

They have summermoon(hot) , wintermoon(over ice) and then half moon which is what I got. The half moon is half as sweet as the summer moon. They make it with what is called moon milk and it's only 7 ingredients but it's a family secret.  The girl who took my order and made my latter also threw in an extra shot for free. Smoothest, and creamiest latte!! I will get one on my way out of Austin!  Only downfall is parking. I did get lucky and pull right into a spot but there isn't enough Peking so park on side street.

Once we hit 5 p.m. traffic in Austin I said let's go get some coffee and bypass this cluster f**k of traffic on 35! We hightailed it to Summermoon and both ordered iced coffees half sweet. If I remember correctly that is a half wintermoon. So delicious and creamy. I can't see myself getting a full amount of sweetener because half was more than enough.

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 4/12/2015 1 check-in Summermoon doesn't seem like the best place to do work. I've never tried but it's sort of small.  That said, I don't do much work at coffeeshops. Usually, the only business I'm attending to is the business of getting caffeine.  Summermoon has a magically thing called moonmilk. I don't really know what's in it (other than, presumably, condensed milk) but it's totally amazing. I have to assume that it's horribly unhealthy because everything that tastes this good has to be unhealthy.  Plus, the wood-roasted coffee really does have a different taste to it. I've got pretty basic taste when it comes to coffee and don't normally have brand preferences but Summermoon is the first coffee I've had that really stood out as better.  The big downside, however, is that it's only open until Midnight M-F and 10PM on Saturday. I drive for Lyft on the weekends and those hours make it hard to swing by for a midnight coffee run on Saturdays. ", pos 
Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 9/19/2014 Listed in Best Coffee Shops Summermoon is a great coffee house with two unique things that make it special.  Let me start with the basics first: there s a parking lot but it can be a challenge at peak times. I have been able to park around the block, which I don''t mind when the coffee is worth it, like at Summermoon.  There is a outdoor seating space and there is plenty of indoor comfy space too. You will almost always find people working or doing homework. Free WiFi of course.  The coffee is very good. I always have a latte or the house latte. The first special thing about this place is their wood fired/roasted coffee. I don't know if it makes the coffee taste better or if I am predisposing myself, but it feels very smooth, almost anti-Stabucks.  The house special uses their own moon mil, which is the other unique thing at Summermoon. It is a bit to sweet and creamy for me but it is different and worth trying.  Right now, this is my go-to place for south central Austin coffee. ", pos

Summer Moon Coffee Bar ," 1/8/2016 6 check-ins Heard about this place from friends that swear by the coffee here. After hearing about how they needed their 'moon milk fix' we wanted to come here New years day but it was closed. I came here for the first time a few days ago, I was waiting to post my review after a second visit to be sure that this deserves the five stars and ordered something different off the menu and was absolutely blown away again. I love how subtle and simple this place is. They have their secret milk recipe and leave it to that to spice up the usual cup of coffee. The first time I came here I ordered the summermoon latte, I was expecting a latte that got most of its flavor from the espresso but was pleasantly surprised with my first sip. I thought the taste was something similar to a soy caramel latte with a little something extra but a million times better. My only complaint was that it was a bit sweet and got a little hard to drink towards the bottom however I got a small and finished it within 5 minutes and wished I ordered a size bigger. I will probably be getting the half moon next time after reading some more reviews saying its not as sweet. Last night I got the espresso milkshake and i'm not sure what I was expecting but again was blown away by the taste. The shake was creamy and delicious. The consistency was easy to drink and wasn't too thick or runny. I'm not sure if they put the moon milk in the shake but the taste was completely different from the summermoon but still had that something extra that made the taste unique. It wasn't too sweet or didn't taste like it was made with tons of artificial syrups. Definitely a place worth going out of the way for and will definitely be frequenting a lot more while I'm in Austin! espresso milkshake moonmilk secret See all photos from Naomi M. for Summer Moon Coffee Bar ", pos

The parking lot is very small and can be difficult to find a spot. The shop has a very hipster feel with lots of people drinking coffee and on their laptops or chatting it up with their friend. It was full for a Thursday late afternoon.  They advertise moon milk as a sweet and creamy blend with 7 secret ingredients. My bf and I decided to try share a 20oz half super moon drink. The half super moon is half the sweetness. I'm not are what was in it but I was delicious!

An intricacy of pristine beans and a mild hint of smokiness from the fire it has been blessed with creates a deep and enchanting flavor that you won't forget with each sip that you take in order to fulfill the desire you have to consume this precious nectar.

I was so sad to hear earlier this year that the owner had passed away and that the fate of the shop was in jeopardy. However, they are open and thriving, so it seems like someone took over the shop.  For vegans (not me, but sometimes), they have an excellent selection of vegan baked goods, vegan coffee options, and vegan ice cream. I've tried most of it, and you might not ever know that it's vegan. The ice cream is particularly delicious.  The non-vegan ice cream (from a company in San Francisco) is also bomb. Particularly the brownie batter fudge! It haunts my dreams.  For the coffee lover, their menu is extensive and contains options most other shops don't have. And the employees have great expertise in their craft. Aside from the expertise, they beans they use are top notch as are all of the other ingredients - leading to some truly excellent coffee.  The parking situation in this center (Black Star, Fuzzy's, etc) is pretty terrible, so be patient and remember that the garage has multiple levels. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 11/17/2016 Listed in In Search of Fantastic Coffee A friend and I came in to Fat Cats a week or so ago in the later evening. We were glad that it was open but over all, were not very impressed by their coffee.  We found it to be bitter, and we both got their homemade syrups and they tasted.....off. The baristas were nice, however, and the atmosphere was almost deli-like with tables against the wall and big cases. Their chalk boards were well done and very beautiful. I'm giving three stars for great ambiance but the coffee could use some work. ", neutral 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 10/1/2016 1 check-in Service: friendly, funny, and attentive baristas!  Atmosphere: chill with a creative vibe and a everybody-knows-your-name kinda feeling.  Coffee: strong and satisfying. I asked for an extra shit of espresso in my small latte and the barista informed me that they put 2 shots standard in their small lattes. YES. Finally, a coffee shop that does it right. Bonus: a selection of syrups made in-house. Get the pumpkin!  I would've given it 5 stars, but I only went once during a trip to Austin. I'll be back, though! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 10/22/2016 1 check-in I have to say this place is pretty good and they have a cute logo. Their double shot of espresso did the trick along their vegan waffles which actually tasted really good. It tasted lightweight as opposed to a non-vegan waffle. The barista will tell you the waffles will take 10 - 20 minutes to make. I had it with the coconut whipped cream and syrup. I'm pretty sure they had other toppings to offer but it was the only one that appealed to me. They had some ice cream, baked goods and waffles. You can have the waffles with ice cream, which I know is an ice cream cone but still sounds good nevertheless. Too bad it's a small place but it has a long bench against the wall with 5-6 tables. If I was living close by, I would come here more often. Vegan waffle with coconut whipped cream.

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 8/3/2016 This place is adorable! I also appreciate the fact that they offer a lot of options as far as different types of baked goods, treats, and drinks goes. I'm not vegan but I did note that there are a lot of vegan options as well, some even looked tastier than their non-vegan counterparts.  The girls at the register were very helpful and friendly, although we had originally stopped in for coffee, the second they mentioned ice cream we had our faces pressed against the freezer glass faster than you can say fat cats. I opted for a scoop of their mint and lemon cookie, the lemon cookie is delicious and I would have dove into that freezer and ate the entire tub if they hadn't been watching.  The latte I ordered was yummy as well, I love that they create their own syrups so that you have the option of drinking a lavender flavored cup of goodness. Coffee shops take note; lavender is a win.  Thanks ladies, you're doing a great job! ", pos

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 6/27/2016 6 check-ins Well after trying a cafe cubano at several coffee places, Fat Cats has my nod as my favorite.  This was the first coffee place I tried a cubano at, thought it was good but really didn't come to appreciate how good until ordering it at several other places and finding it just didn't compare.  The flavor is smooth with just the right amount of sweetness. Fats cats also has ice cream, waffles, donuts and cookies to satisfy your sweet tooth craving.   The Mexican chocolate donut is one of my favorites.  If you like Mexican chocolate with a hint of spicy, this is for you. They also have great teas. Seating is fairly limited, but I've never had an issue getting a table.  Parking is plentiful which is always nice.  It always appears to be clean inside.   Fat cats is definitely in my rotation of coffee shops. Hmmm Treat yourself El Guapo Espresso See all photos from Charles Y. for Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 8/13/2016 4 check-ins HOLY CANOLI AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST COFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE..BECAUSE IT IS.  If you can't tell..I would 10/10 recommend this place. THREE WORDS: coffee ice cubes. That's right people, say goodbye to watered down iced coffee that tastes awful after 15 minutes in the Texas heat. This is revolutionary.  I am not sure how I first heard of Fat Cats but I believe they sell their vegan pastries at other places around town but it was when my friend told me about the COFFEE ICE CUBES when I got in my car and sped right there. After I picked up the iced coffee (an almond milk vanilla iced latte to be exact) I even got out of the car to run an errand and the coffee still tasted delicious instead of watered down grossness. Yum yum yum, new favorite coffee shop! And it's cat themed so right up my alley. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 5/14/2016 1 check-in I was hoping for a lot better experience.  Location/ atmosphere: It's a really really small shop. Pretty limited seating and the tables are tiny and chairs are really awkward to sit in. I came in with two other friends and we sort of sat down (two on the long chairs and me on a smaller chair)- all sort of seated to a tiny table. My first thought when I walked in was ""Is this it??"" Bc the place is just kind of a long so all the tables and seats are all next to each other with not much space. I was glad when we came in it wasn't busy and not very packed because it'd be awkward to have strangers sit so close to you. Overall, small tables with not much room for much. Wouldn't come here for studying or a big group.  Desserts: I came around 7 or 8pm and I don't know if they ran out throughout the day but I didn't see much pastry selection. It was a small display case and no more. So we moved onto the ice cream- which they had a big selection of (Both Vegan and Dairy). They let you try out the flavors with a metal spoon so don't be scared to ask! We each got a flavor (Coconut, Lemon cookies, and the strawberry) and it was pretty good but nothing to really say ""YEAH THAT WAS SPECIAL I'm definitely coming back again!!"" I wish I had tried their coffee (now seeing really great things about their coffee ice cubes).  Service: It was alright. We got served and got stamp cards but I don't think I'll ever come here 10 more times to fill up that card. It'd have been nice if she made some recommendations to what's pretty popular in the store when she saw us squinting at the menu and looking around the shop all indecisive.  Overall, an average place- but disclaimer: I'm not a vegan!! So I guess the people who are.. really appreciate this place! Stawberry Lemon cookies and Coconut icecream (all dairy) ", neutral

They offer gf ice cream cones (sugar and regular cones) and a variety of gf cookies.  I got the gf chocolate chip and almond milk chai. The chai takes a few minutes to make since they brew to order.  It was pretty good but was a little heavy on the cinnamon and ginger side for my liking. The gf cookie though!  Yummy!  Just the right amount of chocolate chips and chewy, my fav quality.

There are plenty of organic coffee/espresso/tea options for whatever you happen to be in the mood for, be it a standard black coffee, a latte, macchiato, cafe au lait, or a variety of brewed teas, they make it! They also have a variety of different syrups made in-house that can be added to any brew.  There are also a variety of desserts available to satisfy any sweet tooth. These range from cookies and donuts to mini pies and ice cream (both dairy and vegan versions). I've had a few of their ice creams (both versions) and have loved every flavor I've tried. You can also ask for a spoonful to try if you can't decide!  The atmosphere is cozy, the wifi satisfactory and the employees are super nice. Great place to visit! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 8/5/2016 1 check-in I love Fat Cats.  I work way too close to it so I must exercise some restraint.  I admit I haven't had much of the food there. I typically have tea, of which they have an incredible variety, or an almond milk latte which is always made with care and served in a nice big mug. On a particularly hot day I enjoyed an Italian soda which they were kind enough to make less sweet for me because I'm a big baby with stuff that's too sweet.  The servers/baristas are both kind and knowledgeable. Especially with tea. When I stare blankly at their impressive menu they are quick to help with welcome suggestions. It's wonderful that they have so many allergen and vegan-diet friendly options and that they do their best to offer organic items. Wish more places would follow in their footsteps with those initiatives.  Get a punch card!  One thing I wish they would re-consider or invest in if the opportunity comes would be wall outlets and comfier seating. I would love to hang out here and study/work/read. I'd be motivated (for better or worse) to purchase more stuff there because you can't sit in front of all those treats for very long without convincing yourself you need one.  I'm not deducting a star because the point of the layout may indeed have been to discourage people staying around. I have worked in food establishments where we preferred to push people out after a bit. But, I think the beauty of coffee shops is that it can be a place to get away from home and hang for a bit, so I'd certainly do that at Fat Cats if it were an option. ", pos

They make a great traditional chai (warning: it takes about 10 minutes). The place is cute, and every time I go they're adding more to the atmosphere. There are always a few folks seated; working and enjoying coffee.  Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of the coffee they brew - the flavor seems off for me. (I'm one of those horrible people that likes the Starbucks flavor). But where they get me are the baked goods (most/all are vegan I believe).

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 11/10/2015 1 check-in Just moved near this location so I had to check it out. And I'm glad I did!  Now, I could never be vegan (I love all types of food waaaay too much), but this place had me thinking I could change my ways. Everything in their display case looked delicious and all of it was either gluten free, vegan, or organic. They also have vegan icecream! So, if you qualify as one of those things check this place out for the desserts  Let's move onto the coffee! My iced coffee was probably one of the best I've had in this city. It was delicious and I was able to get it with soy (any type of milk you could possibly think of, I would bet they have) for free of charge. Also they make their own sweeteners which are also organic and delicious. The coolest part of my iced coffee was that they used ice cubes that are made out of frozen coffee (genius idea. why don't more places do this??) so the coffee flavor was not watered down at all. Also, a nice bonus was that after finishing my drink I let the ice cubes melt and had a second iced coffee. It was like getting a free refill which made my cheap self very excited.  The only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is due to their latte.  We ordered the pumpkin spice latte (#basic #fall) and it was not as amazing as my iced coffee. There was a lot of foam and the pumpkin spice flavor was a little lackluster.  However, living in Texas, it's pretty much warm year round so I don't need hot drinks to make me sweat even more than I do. I'll stick to the iced coffee here and be the happiest and most caffeinated person in the world.  Definitely try this place out!

It was like 6 bucks. The service was quick. Then again, there were 2 girls behind the counter and only a couple other patrons there. The wifi was fast.  Loses one star. Why?

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/29/2015 Pretty adorable little spot in an albeit unsuspecting location. We stopped here the other night for some vegan ice cream after dinner. I was glad that the lady was willing to provide a few samples for me since I hadn't been there before. I ordered from the vegan side, which is all Coconut Bliss coconut milk ice cream. Ordered a half and half scoop, which was awesome, since I didn't want to do two scoops just to get two flavors. Not all places are that accommodating.  They'd already put the baked goods away, which seems like poor business to me. My brother, who goes frequently, said that's common practice for them to empty out the bakery case hours before closing. The woman said if there was anything we wanted, she could get it from the back, but it's hard to know what I want if I can't see it: the texture, the size, the potential for deliciousness entreating me to spend more money. I hope they'll reconsider this practice in the future.  Also of note: loyalty cards. My brother got a punch for each of us, and I got mint chocolate chip. Score. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/23/2015 I happened by Fat Cats after a work lunch at Blackstar, and was feeling caffeineedy. I got a run of the mill iced latte with almond milk. The coffee is fantastic (I noticed that there is a daily roast card, and that they were out of some beans which is a plus in my book) and I was very pleased with how quickly it was made. It's also VERY reasonably priced.  On a whim, I decided to have it iced, and I am very glad I did. The ice is made with coffee instead of water. I'm thrilled! I am so excited this little cup is going to last me for more than the 30 minutes it would normally take to nurse it a little.  The reason it's a four instead of five star is because I like my coffee shops to feel a little less like frozen yogurt places (bright and sterile), more like a friend's house.  Excellent job, Fat Cats. I will make it a point to come back for dessert when I'm in less of a rush and will update my review! ", pos

We tried the banana nut loaf, decaf americanos, and the Mexican chocolate doughnut. -The banana nut bread was a *little* bit dry but very tasty, not-too-sweet, with really rich chocolate chips.   -The coffee was FANTASTIC.  Couldn't believe it was decaf.  (Also, awesome: it was about the same price as Starbucks, if not cheaper.  Hard to find great coffee for that price.) -For us, the highlight was the Mexican chocolate doughnut in combination with the coffee.  We both like spicy foods with our coffee so this was just right.  Like the bread, it wasn't too sweet but was SO perfectly chocolatey with a nice spiciness from cayenne pepper.  I'll be back for this!

Their coffee is Fair Trade. Iced coffee is a delicious cold brew and served with coffee ice cubes so it won't get watered down! Genius! Milk is from grass fed cows, or any kind of nondairy. Coffee syrups are home made.  I didn't get to try their baked goods because their oven was broken but I hear they will all be vegan.  They have a deluxe ice cream menu featuring 8 or 10 flavors each of vegan and dairy ice creams. The vegan ice cream is Coconut Bliss brand, not sure where they get the dairy version. They have organic toppings like vegan gummy bears and marshmallows. They even have a nondairy hot fudge and coconut whipped cream.  My only complaint is that the hot fudge serving is a bit skimpy. I went back and paid for a second serving to make it come out with my ice cream.  That may be a cost control issue, as it's clearly made with high quality chocolate. ", pos

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 4/14/2016 This is a very nice coffee shop that is a good place to study/work and grab some organic/vegan snacks.  Things to know:  Pros - Good selection of vegan and non-dairy ice creams, as well as traditional ice cream. - Nice pastry/bakery options for vegans as well -  Square tables good for doing work at - Coffee is pretty good - Great selection of teas, which are also good - Super cute environment - parking directly outside storefront (2Hr spots)  Cons - no outlets for plugging in computers. (no biggie. Just charge your stuff before you come) - Small store, so could potentially get crowded easily. (It was not crowded when I went on a weekday afternoon) - Bench seating makes up half the seating of every table, as the bench and tables line one wall of the place. I didn't mind it because it wasn't busy, but you might end up smooshed up next to someone on a busy day.  What I got:  Matcha vegan baked donut: I actually really liked the donut. It was spiced really well and very moist. Very cake-like. The matcha is in the icing, which does have a good matcha flavor, but is also very, very sweet. It was too sweet for me to finish the donut. But if you love super-sweet icing you'll probably like the donut overall.  Latte with almond milk. Really good. Very strong dark roast flavor.  Scoop of Vegan Ginger cookie ice cream and scoop of regular Cardamom flavor ice cream. both were delicious!  Sun, Moon, and Stars iced green tea. Very pleasant.  And I just loved seeing all the little touches in decor like the black bowler hat light shades.  Overall, I really liked it there. The night manager, Ariel, was tending the place the afternoon that I went and she was very nice and personable.  I'll definitely be going back. The bar to the left of the ice creams. Matcha Donut.

Got a Belgian Waffle with 1 scoop Sea Salted Caramel Ice Cream and 1 scoop Butterscotch Pecan Ice Cream. The shop prides itself in having vegan and gluten-free items, which didn't really matter to me but others would appreciate. The waffle was great, it had a hint of cinnamon which really added to the flavor. The waffle was nicely crisp on the outside to hold onto and balance the ice cream, with an airy and fluffy inside. The ice cream was delicious (the flavors we got were made with dairy but they do offer dairy-free kinds) and really went well with the waffle.

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 1/2/2016 Really happy with the service and quality. I come here pretty regularly, and the coffee is well made, the iced coffee cubes are genius. The baked goods and ice cream are lovely. I adore the drinking chocolate as well (ladies, if you're having an insatiable hormone driven chococraving this is the cure).  Definitely recommended.  I'm hoping they'll start doing custom cakes soon, as I have a wedding coming up.  ;) ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 5/28/2016 Listed in Austin Cafes: Coffee vs Community or Both! I appreciate that Crestview Station is mixed-used, with diverse retailers that are trying to up the development's cool factor, but the lack of character and characters here, and at Midtown Grocery, Black Star, et al., is what keeps me from becoming a regular at any of them. The interior of Fat Cats is sterile by design, but they've done a nice job establishing a living room vibe, with their bookcase, toys, games, and... lack of outlets. Yes, I will actually make that a point of praise! There aren't enough tables for someone to stake a claim for hours, and the desserts attract plenty of couples on dates, who want to sit down, albeit it briefly, to make an experience of it, which they deserve to because the menu is really creative and special. When I went, there actually was someone set up with her computer, so I had to have my single (not cat) lady date at home. A sour note on the menu, though, I think it is too big, and opted not to order a drink, being overwhelmed by the abundance of choice. However, the pastry selection is scaled back to protect against waste, and keep the case fresh and original, which I like a lot! ", neutral

They always have an above average variety of treats in the bakery case, and the coffee does not disappoint! They have vegan Belgian waffles and many flavors of non-dairy ice cream, both of which I am looking forward to trying (after which I will update my review)!! The baristas have been nothing but super pleasant too. Fat Cats hosts the perfect atmosphere for some Joe, a treat, and gossip with a friend! ", pos

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 4/28/2016 This place was awesome. We went for the baked donuts and because their baked goods are vegan. They were out of most bakery items but keep in mind we went late in the evening.  We had cafe con leche, mexican snickerdoodle cookies and scones. Yum! The cafe was not true cuban coffee atleast not like I had in Miami. But it was still great coffee. The service was slow but very courteous and professional.  There was only one person working and seemed like everyone decided to all come at once.  The coffee is made to order so it does take longer but definitely worth the wait! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 6/4/2016 i find that a cafe that serves a macchiato in the true way (espresso+foam) deserves a 3 stars on its own. barista was really attentive. tried the mexican chocolate donut, really nice and spiced very good addition to my macchiato. my friend got the mocha and get this, the ice is made from coffee! nice touch there guys, really loving the flavor profile of the mocha here. they got ice cream as well, both vegan and non-vegan. would come here again.

Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/9/2015 1 check-in Listed in Yummy in my Tummy I dropped my boyfriend off at the barber shop and was craving coffee. Yelp told me this was the closest coffee shop so I decided to give it a try. It was a little confusing to find the shop due to the location and parking is very minimal, but I made my second loop around and caught a car leaving and waited for their spot. When I walked in, I was the only customer there. I was assisted by a super friendly employee who gave me honest feedback on the dog treats instead of just trying to sell to me (I asked if they were hard since my dog refuses to eat hard dog treats and she said they are). I got two donuts (my sweet tooth was bigger than my stomach) and an iced caramel latte. Excuse my french, but it was all SEX IN MY MOUTH. I honestly think it was the best coffee drink I've ever had - and they even offer coffee ice cubes for iced drinks. I only ate one of the donuts but the sweet lady was nice enough to give me a to go box for the other one. I actually cried over the other donut cause my boyfriend ate it :'( DONUT JUDGE ME, they were that good!  The only thing I didn't like was that there was no outside seating, and the inside seating was kind of awkward. I was there by myself and the only customer there at the time, so I would've liked to sit outside. Best coffee I've had yet. ", pos

I go in with my laptop fully charged, knowing that I'll also find some delicious dairy-free breakfast options (if you haven't tried it yet, I *highly* recommend the Mexican chocolate donut!). They were even super helpful at crafting a delicious green tea with mint and honey for me when I was indecisive about what kind of drink I was looking for. Overall, I love love love this place. The only heads up I would give is that they do not have multiple outlets, so this would not be ideal for an all-day study place... but excellent if, like me, you sometimes want to keep yourself from working too much or make yourself take a break once your laptop battery is drained. :) ", pos

Can't wait to go back for coffee and other yummy treats! ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 11/9/2015 I am excited that my neighborhood coffee shop has great reviews so far, but unfortunately my experience has been slightly different. I came in several times right after they opened and each time was just lacking. The drinks took a really long time to make and the service was so... bland. They hit a low point when I went in with a friend one evening and we both ordered the chai tea - mine with almond milk and hers with regular milk. The girl at the counter called out that our drinks were ready and I went to grab them. Both were in mugs and I asked which was which. In response I got, ""Um, I think that's the almond."" So away we went. My friend and I were deep in conversation, enjoying our chai teas when the owner comes over and says, ""I think you're drinking the wrong ones."" She picked up each of our mugs, sniffed them, and says, ""Yep, you're drinking each other's..."" and proceeds to switch our mugs! Keep in mind we were halfway finished with our drinks at this point. It was a huge turnoff and just made for a really awkward moment--and they should thank their lucky stars that I'm not lactose intolerant or vegan... or a really mean Yelper.  I was going to write this review a few weeks ago, but seeing as they are fairly new and growing pains are normal and expected, I decided to give them another shot... and I can say that they are really improving.  Some good stuff: Coffee ice cubes. Great idea and I wish more coffee shops would do this. The coffee and tea menus are huge and include stuff you don't see in every coffee shop: cafe cubano, cortadito, traditional indian chai, etc. Homemade syrups are also a plus as well as their selection of vegan ice cream, dairy ice cream, and baked goods. I have not gotten around to trying the treats yet, but they look pretty good. Service also seems to have improved. Kelsey was super friendly and made my friend and I feel very welcome last week. The espresso drinks have been a bit on the weak side but good nonetheless. ", neutral 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert , 10/9/2015 Stopped by here  while on a work trip and got a hot chocolate. I don't do regular dairy and they were really accommodating - offered multiple alternatives. The result was delicious! It was just enough sweet and just enough rich. The ice cream selection looked fantastic  and I wish I could have indulged in it! The atmosphere was conducive for conversations with friends or to just do work. Wish there was a place like this near where I live! , pos

Your patience is rewarded with home-baked scones and muffins, home-made ice cream toppings and home-made waffle cones.  All of it is organic.  All of it served by friendly staff with a smile.  They have loyalty cards; get one because you will need it.  They have plenty of ice cream flavours and give out free samples if you ask.  Some flavours are vegan-friendly.  The music isn't too loud and they have some fantastic decor.  Attention to detail in this regard is spectacular.  By using Third Coast Coffee Roaster's beans Fat Cats is supporting a local business.  They have free wifi; use it to write a Yelp review.  I wish this local business the best for the future. ", pos

Can't wait to try the waffles next time. ", pos 
Fat Cats Organic Coffee And Dessert ," 12/9/2015 I love this place! The baked vegan donuts are delicious and have a great texture. The coffee is the best that I've had in this city to date. My favorite part, however, is the tea menu. They have a wide selection of teas that can be ordered by the cup or pot. I've been to plenty of coffee shops where they simply put a tea bag in hot water which is so wrong! Not here! They take the time to make a proper pot of tea with the correct temperatures and time for the type of tea. Finally! An affordable pot of tea made properly. I'm in heaven. The place is clean, bright, and quiet. If I lived closer I would visit daily, but I am happy that I can go in the weekends. I plan to try the waffles and ice cream next. Happy to see more delicious vegan options in this city. ", pos

This is the adult version of the Baskin Robbins that was so popular as a kid.  The only reason why I didn't give it more stars was the limited seating and lack of outlets.  This could be due to the fact that the free parking is limited to two hours, however the quality of the food/drink offerings would attract customers willing to stay here and consume things all afternoon.  I'll definitely be coming back to get work done and have another cherry pie a la mode. ", pos

Not only did they have non dairy options (soy,almond AND coconut), the owner who took my order also recommended the one that would taste the best.  I am a little bit of a chai snob and can't handle the powders or concentrated mixes that you find at most places around town.  This is the real deal.  I can't wait to go back for some dessert!

Epoch Coffee ," 10/24/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 Yelp 100, The Sweet Spots!, Coffee Shops with Latte Art 24/7 coffee shop that offers great coffee, spacious and plenty of seating option, along with yummy snack bites!!! Why can't we have something like this in DFW already??? Maybe they're not ready for people like me who would definitely ""camp"" out over night at their coffee shop if there was one in Dallas :(  After our late dinner, I wanted something sweet, surprise, not. Checking out at least couple new coffee shops while in Austin was also on my to do list. Epoch was only about 10mins from where we were at, and stays open 24/7 made it the perfect pick.  It took us a few minutes looking for a parking spot in their small lot. We gave up and decided to park on the street, ur best option. The coffee shop was packed at almost 11pm on a Thursday night, not too big of a surprise since it's not far from UT, swamped with night owls was completely understandable.  We each got a hazelnut latte. I was a lil disappointed to see somewhat of crappy latte art on both, but the delicious, smooth latte made up for it, along with their delicious strawberry rhubarb pie, making my first experience with rhubarb pie a great one.  We would have stayed here longer if the mosquitoes didn't like me too much and started munching on me. First coffee shop on my list for this Austin trip was a win and a success in my book, regardless of the disappointing latte art, I'm definitely looking forward to the next time coming back here! Strawberry rhubarb pie. So good! Hazelnut latte. No real latte art :( Hazelnut latte with almond milk. Great coffee! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/22/2016 This is a great coffee shop to post up for a marathon work session - it's got lots of tables, outlets, and other people who are also working who are willing to share those tables and outlets with you. It's busy pretty much constantly, but I've never not been able to find a spot to sit down! The coffee is decent, the latte art is pretty, and it's got a cool atmosphere.  I do have some qualms with this place, though, namely the staff. I get that not everyone is into the whole ""service with a smile"" thing, and that's totally okay with me! But I shouldn't feel like I'm inconveniencing you every time I order something. Generally, I get an annoyed look while I order and have been treated like I'm dumb every time I ask a question. Not really what I'm looking for in a coffee shop, and I've stopped coming here as much because of the service. (Especially when Brentwood Social House just opened up down the road and the service and seating are excellent.)  I also really dislike that the ""smoking"" and ""non-smoking"" sections of their side patio. Because we all know smoke travels with air, unless they put a wall between the two sections it really does nothing to prevent being bombarded with cigarette smoke. Smokers, I've got nothing against you personally, but you smell bad and I want to be able to sit outside without increasing my risk of lung cancer. Just sayin'. ", neutral

The service is very quick.  Best of all they are open 24 hours so you never have to worry that they might be closed which is one of my pet peeves about other coffee shops in town.

SH$%. How hard guys? That's all- I recommend going at 3-4am, there may be one or two seats available...  ***UPDATE end***  Reason #1: They are open 24/7 Reason #2: They have GREAT coffee.  It's not like they have a ton of options or make world changing coffee, but it is really really good and consistent. Mojo is strong but tasty and the Mexican Mocha is my go to... Reason #3: They have a good sized patio Reason #4: There is this attractive creepy feeling about the place that makes you just wanna go get coffee there like every day...it may be the State Mental hospital cemetery across the parking lot...maybe not...maybe it's their shrine tip candles...  Interlude: I just read Sean C's review and almost spit out my drink laughing...it's true though, it does seem like there's people that look like they've been there for seven days and seven nights and have used the dingy bathroom for a bird bath session.  And I have seen the boxes and boxes of pizza they stack in their fridge's to sell to people, but I don't eat at Epoch, I go for coffee...but I see it as a courtesy...they're like, yeah some people may get hungry sitting here we can provide some noms for the hungry etc.  I don't use the internet here, I use my own hotspot so I don't know if it's good for working...I assume that the internet is good considering 95% of the people there sipping on coffee are on their laptops.

Epoch is perfect for those in need of caffeination. I kept things simple with a 16oz coffee with half and half, but that coffee was definitely expertly brewed. Every drop was definitely worth savoring. My coffee's companion of a blueberry muffin was excellent as well.  The staff were kind and quick with good service.

Epoch Coffee ," 6/26/2016 2 check-ins I enjoy this little coffee shop. It's located in a little unassuming strip mall with a records store and vintage clothing boutique. The coffee shop itself is fairly large on the inside (for a coffee shop), with a few board games for patrons to play and a random assortment of chairs and couches for people to sit on. There's free wifi and a patio in case you'd like to bring your dog. The patio is separated into a smoking and non-smoking section, so you get to enjoy being outdoors without being bombarded with smoke if you wish. I've only ever gotten the iced coffee, which comes in a large glass that can be refilled for $2. Service has always been quick. There are a variety of other coffee/espresso options on the menu as well as different milks (dairy and non-dairy) that can be added. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/18/2016 2 check-ins Pretty clutch 24 hour coffee/pizza place in north Austin, I got the olivia slice one night, and the moon walker slice the other, and a chocolate chip cookie, all were really good, im glad they had the moon walker which was white sauce as you don't see that all the time, I'd have loved to try the coffee but it was 2am each time and might not have been the best idea :p hopefully i can try it next time i'm back!

Epoch Coffee ," 8/20/2016 Chill atmosphere, and a great place to go if you happen to be up late. Love that it's open 24/7!  The drink selection isn't my favorite in Austin, but I still think it's pretty good. Great place to study! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 1/17/2016 7 check-ins I love being in walking distance of Epoch. I'm not the biggest coffee drinker, so you may wonder why I bother coming here. I am a huge fan of green tea and the peppermint iced green tea is definitely awesome.  I have had the mojo and found it delicious as well.  I love the atmosphere. Inside is cozy and typically has some good music playing (sometimes a little too loudly, but oh well) and outside is a great spot to people watch and enjoy good weather. The staff is friendly and quick. Overall one of my favorite spots on North Loop ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 10/12/2015 1 check-in 4.5 stars but rounding up since they are open 24/7!! MOJO = DELICIOUS COFFEE. We came in on a Sunday morning for a coffee, and encountered this gigantic coffee shop with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating (you can bring your dogs!). Since the mojo is pre-sweetened, and made with dairy, I decided to play it safe by ordering a 1/2 Iced Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee ($4, yelp.com/user_local_phot…), which was perfect- it wasn't too sweet, and my occasional lactose intolerance didn't kick in. This is highly recommended since it had a great smooth/creamy texture. I would definitely come back just for this. The parking lot is big so parking in the larger back lot shouldn't be an issue- however, the front parking spots that are closer to the entrance fill up quickly. 1/2 Iced Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee ($4) ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/13/2016 4 check-ins I was craving a Mexican mocha from Epoch so had to stop by before work. I bought a coffee to go and a bagel for about $6. Not Bad. This place is open 24/7 so I never have to worry if I'm too early. It smells so good once you enter. There's nothing like walking into an aroma of coffee and sweets, just a bunch of healthy goodness.

Epoch Coffee ," 11/18/2015 10 check-ins My roommate loves to study at coffee shops, so I tend to tag along when she invites me. Epoch is conveniently located near where we live, so when it's possible, we walk there. The parking lot gets pretty crowded (typical Austin), and nothing is more of a deterrent from studying than when parking becomes frustrating.  I've never been to Epoch in the day time just because I tend to study better in the evening. It's always a gamble whether I'll find a table or not when I get there because Epoch is always busy at night (yay 24 hour coffee shop!). Pounce on a table when you spy someone packing up to leave.  The wifi here is pretty dependable. Though I have a sneaky suspicion that they'll turn off the wifi (and crank the AC up) to get rid of customers around midnight. I've made it past the point of no wifi and freezing temperatures (around 1AM), and I can affirm that they do turn the wifi back on.  The coffee is decent and will tide you through studying, but nothing really stands out to me. I'd highly recommend the chocolate cake though. They give you a large slice, and it's rich and moist.  Service is alright. It meets my standard of hipster coffee shop service. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/4/2016 This is succccchhh a cool coffee shop. Outside seating, indoor vintage interior and furniture. I love it. I grabbed an ice coffee and chilled outside. It was lovely.

Epoch Coffee ," 6/4/2016 1 check-in Listed in Austin, TX Great place to study. An abundant amount of tables inside and out. Wifi was pretty fast given the amount of people there. Plenty of outlet space. This place is really unique in that aspect. However I can see it getting filled up pretty quick. I was there before 8 and already more than half of the inside was full.  Espreesso and food were not...great. I felt the espresso tasted really burnt. The breakfast wrap was ok. There are not a lot of food options nor variety. Would not come here for eating or drinking.

Epoch Coffee ," 9/17/2016 By far my favorite coffee house in Hyde Park and the surrounding area. Open 24/7 and inhabited by easygoing, down to earth people (customers and staff alike), Epoch provides ample seating (indoor and out-), places to plug-in, and free, strong-signal wifi. However, it can get quite busy, at times, making finding a seat a challenge sometimes. The food and goodie selection is better than average, and includes various yummy vegan offerings. The coffee snob in me gives their coffee products a 7/10--which is good, just not great--and I wish their coffee menu were a little more extensive. However, those are just minor gripes. Epoch is definitely a quality establishment worth patronizing. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/26/2016 When I moved to Austin in 2011, I set out to find a good coffee shop. A good coffee place is like a solid base of operations. You can use it to do your taxes, meet someone new, play chess, drink coffee, design a scale model Smurfs village, read a book.  But a truly outstanding coffee shop has a consistently friendly and genuinely kind staff that seems like family. That's really what I get every time I go to Epoch.  Being the introvert-extrovert, I know the staff all recognize my face and none probably know me by name (that's my fault). And those people make the place shine. They of course represent the eclectic and interesting tastes of the Austin community and I would expect nothing less.  Fantastic music plays in the background at all hours. Local artists get display space on the walls. The same guys come in and play four-way chess every Sunday. There's a guy named John who's always there. It's like Cheers but with ACC students and a table in the back that seems to attract Tinder first dates.  There's plenty of indoor and outdoor seating: sofas, large cushioned chairs, wooden chairs, stools. There are pull-down electrical outlets for the tables away from the walls. There's indoor wifi. There's also a little mini deli by the cash register with sandwiches, wraps, muffins, cookies. They serve coffee, kombucha, tea, and you can even order a pizza. No one will go hungry here.  There's a strange air about the place. It feels a bit vulnerable, like home. When I walk in on any given day, whether it's after I've rowed on the lake or had a long day at work, I always feel like I could meet someone new (and I often do) and form an instant real connection.  It's just a good place. Check it out. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 9/2/2016 1 check-in I have nothing bad to say about this place. The coffee and teas are great. The customers are a mix of students, hipsters, locals, and poets that are left of center. Very relaxed place. Steady stream of customers, but I have never experienced an unreasonably long wait. Great stop during the day. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/1/2015 1 check-in I was visiting a friend in Austin and Epoch was right across the street so I thought I'd check it out and get some work in for a couple hours. I'm not a big coffee drinker so you should be asking yourself why is he here but I was happy to see they have smoothies. I went with the Pineapple Paradise and yes it was paradise in my mouth. I'm not really sure what was in it other than pineapple but I'm not complaining! They also have pizza by the slice and I went with the white pizza (it has a crazy name which I can't remember). Solid and thin crust but a little pricey at $3.25 or $3.75 a slice...my memory is escaping me.  Maybe because the sightseeing at Epoch is spectacular. Hipsters galore in all assortments of ridiculous outfits. Even a girl with armpit hair, hooray! You will not be disappointed trust me. This is better than sightseeing at the airport or your local Walmart. ", pos

Okay let me write this review which needs to be written. My God, I haven't been here before. It was raining in Austin and instead of staying home, I developed a case of cabin fever which you might think is the worst time to get it. Usually when it rains, it's unsafe to drive in this weather. I decided to brave the elements and decide to go out. I'm glad I did. Parking can be a nuisance but I was fortunate to find parking in their parking lot. When I enter where every table is full of people studying and working on their laptops. Service was great and I had some of their iced coffee. There was plenty of outside seating which I didn't mind sitting because I love watching the rain. A big plus was when they were playing Jesus and the Mary Chain. It doesn't get any perfect. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/19/2016 6 check-ins The vibe of epoch, the furniture, the lighting - all very cool. I'm just not a big fan of their espresso.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/5/2014 14 check-ins Epoch is my FAVORITE spot to hang out in Austin. It is an artsy, eclectic, WEIRD art gallery, coffee shop, wireless mecca. You can post up all day and get some work done, hang out with a friend, enjoy a date, read a good book, or just chill out on the lovely outdoor deck. The beverage selection is SUPERB.  The hubby and I have claimed two well-broken in chairs as our own and are thrilled when they are both available, as it gets quite busy over at Epoch what with all of the students frequent this haunt.  The people watching at Epoch is a hobby in its own right!  It's a perfect microcosm for the city, attracting people of all ages and creeds. As I'm not a coffee person, I usually enjoy a Caramel Italian Cream Soda or a delicious Mexican Hot Chocolate with whipped cream while my husband sips on a double espresso.    My favorite thing about Epoch is the Peewee Herman doll sitting high above all of us minions looking down upon us with benevolence.  One really interesting fact about is that Epoch as a Geocache hidden on its premises!  If you are new to geocaching, this is a cool one to start with.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/15/2015 1 check-in First time here and I'm not overly impressed. I came with two other people and they seem to have the same sentiment. Atmosphere is nice, even though the music can be way too loud. Coffee and drinks are ok; we liked the Mexican Hot Chocolate. The staff did not care one bit that we were there. They're pretty sub par actually, and gave us an attitude.  Seems like an ok place to study, but it's more of a hipster cliche than anything. Meh.  Shoutout to the barista with tape on his glasses: you're a barista, you make coffee. You're not a distinguished artist or playwright so please smile, take yourself less seriously, and remove the obstruction from your bowels that's affecting your service. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/14/2016 While not being a coffee drinker, I have extremely high praise for this coffee house. Nestled into a quiet North Loop neighborhood, their copious amount of seating (and power outlets), speedy wifi, and incredibly friendly staff makes this place a hidden gem. I ordered their Moon Tower pizza slice (since I forgo coffee) and it was very tasty - hand prepared after I ordered - not some pre-packaged cold alternative. Overall, a very big fan and will be returning! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 6/25/2016 My wife and I are regulars here. We almost always order the Mexican Mocha, although we've tried the teas, mojo, and iced coffee and all were good. 4/5 times the coffee is perfect and definitely a favorite. Unfortunately, every now and then the milk is not hot enough which completely kills the mocha for me.  In the mornings, they also sell tacos, the Princess Leia is my favorite. Even though they are not made there, they are always warm.  This location in particular is often full, so we normally take it to go. However, we love to sit in when they are not as packed.  Definitely recommend it! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/6/2015 3 check-ins Listed in a latte love There's pretty much only two main twenty-four seven coffee houses in Austin for students to pull those dreaded all-nighters: Bennu and Epoch. Each has their own little charm although the one thing they have in common is the dark and [slightly] cozy atmosphere (...sometimes) and the overcrowded parking lots and even more overcrowded unavailable seats.  I go to Epoch a lot. In memory of all those late-night study moments and even later nights catching up with old friends, Epoch has become an honorary friend. How could a friend rank any lower than four stars? Epoch has kept me going far too often for me to actually think it's any less.  But let's go with the truth on this review:  I do like Epoch. I wouldn't go if I didn't like it at least a little. Their coffee is aight, and I stay awake for the most part. Personally, I've gone far past immune on caffeine alone and only stay alive with the help of loads of sugar, so the only thing that really helps me is their sweet mochas.  But to be honest--their coffee, as I've said only a moment ago, is simply... simply aight. From their black coffee to their lattes to their mochas and even their special (the Iced Mojo), if I were thinking of coffee alone, I wouldn't actually say Epoch serves the best or my favorite.  I don't really like the Iced Mojo--not even the half. I think it tastes like watered down coffee and sweetener. Their regular coffee isn't bad. I think it's better than Bennu's--at least their late night servings, anyway. It's a little on the sour side of coffee, if anyone knows what I mean by that. Their flavored lattes are super sweet. It's kind of ridiculous how sweet they are. I like their mochas--they're sweet but on the richer side with a deeper undertone. I prefer the Mexican Mocha over the Dutch because it has a sweeter flavor to it.  Their music taste is quite a variety. Sometimes, it works while I study. Other times, it overpowers my music in the weirdest ways possible. I don't really need metal at 3 AM, thanks...  Service is a mix, depending on the day. I've had friendly baristas (usually the older ones), and I've had unfriendly baristas (usually the younger ones). Weird how that works, I guess.  Do I think Epoch is great? Not really. But I prefer it a lot more than Bennu's, and I can't give it any less of a rating because it has been so kind to all those terrible nights of studying...  So to 24/7 coffee houses. There only need be more of them. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/28/2015 1 check-in I came here on the way to a canoeing trip and it was so early that I was dying for coffee to function.  I just ordered a regular coffee and whatever beans they use are amazing!  It had the flavor, the kick you need and I didn't feel bad parting with my money after the cup was empty.  I also loved the interior; not too fancy and inviting!  Also, super convenient to I-35 and more than enough parking!  They also have breakfast tacos that are really delicious and made to order!  You can't beat this for the price, quality and quick service on food and beverage items! ", pos

I never stuck around to enjoy the ambiance, but that's not Epoch's fault. It seems like a good place to crack open your laptop and get some work done, or catch up with an old friend.

Epoch Coffee ," 2/9/2015 1 check-in Expectations of a 24 hour Austin coffee shop: 1). Super hipster barista--met by enthusiastic bearded fellow with long hair and a ""bike shop"" (based on overheard convo with other customers) and stray dogs he feeds 2) Tons of people writing next 50 Shades or developing next Pay Pal--met by tons of people plugged into the nifty overhead reel cords (like you'd have in your garage or shop) 3) eclectic decor--met by bathroom (see my photo) 4) Smokers consuming many types of product--met by numerous outdoor patrons (note to guy probably smoking weed--pay attention to wind direction--you must not be a hunter--sitting ""up front"" would have been more undercover!!) 5) And, oh by the way, coffee!--met by lovely drink I had. 6) snacks--the reason I'm only giving 4 stars--they had nothing gluten free except maybe breakfast tacos which were already pretty much sold out by my time of arrival. I did not ask about these--if they were corn tortilla, then they would qualify. But would it be too much trouble to toss a macaroon into the pastry case?   Great place to hang out and get something done. Huge indoor and outdoor seating--right near a little stream. Classy restroom graffiti. Mocha art ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 2/17/2016 As a college student and avid coffee drinker (go figure), I've been trying to find some new coffee shops for a good study sesh. After reading some of the reviews here, I had high hopes for this place. I read such good things about the Mojo and, not being too crazy about super sweet drinks, I went with 1/2 Mojo, 1/2 Iced Coffee. I was hoping for something along the lines of a Summer Moon or a strong coffee flavor with smooth cream. Maybe it's because I got half, but I was pretty let down. First, it tasted watered down, like adding nonfat milk to weak coffee. Second, it tasted artificially sweetened. If you're a Starbucks person who gets iced coffee with nonfat milk, no classic, and a couple Splendas (I have credible Starbucks knowledge, trust), then the 1/2 Mojo is your cup of tea, rather, coffee. I'm not sure I want to spend about $4 to try a normal Mojo. ALSO..the guy at the register seemed like the type of guy who would often rub people the wrong way (no, not literally, you nasty. JK). At first, they forgot to add our bagel dog (tastes alriiiight) to our order, an honest mistake. Then, after waiting probably a good 20 minutes, turns out no one put it in the oven. Understandable if they were super busy, but there were maybe 2 other customers waiting.  Now, the study experience. Wi-Fi is great. I have yet to experience any internet failure. They even have separate wifis for inside and outside. They have a number of tables and comfy looking couches and chairs. Unfortunately, the spot my friend and I chose had loose outlets so our plugs wouldn't stay connected. It's fine though, nothing a rubberband couldn't fix. Points for that Asian ingenuity! Okay, so it's 73 degrees outside and I'm kind of freezing in here. If you plan on staying for a while and you don't know how the study-at-a-coffee-shop thing goes, a jacket is a necessity. (I left mine in the car, stupid me) Which brings me to the parking lot, which actually isn't too bad. I was fortunate enough to find an open spot in the filled lot right when I turned in. But the lot is pretty big, so I wouldn't worry TOO much.  All in all, this place isn't bad, but probably won't be my go-to study spot. This is my first review, so don't totally take my word for it, but I've had my fair share of coffee shop experiences. You kind of have to get a feel of this place yourself. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/14/2016 I love the atmosphere of Epoch -- very hipster and cozy. The main reason I drive so far to study at Epoch is because they're open 24/7. Their Mexican mocha is also superb. The only thing that bothers me is their rude staff. I've had multiple occurrences where the staff is not only unfriendly, but also very apathetic and borderline rude towards customers. It almost feels like they're put out to have you there or service you. Not every single employee has been rude, but the general vibe of the staff is completely disinterested and bothered by the needs of their customers. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 1/8/2015 Listed in My Fix, Second Home Epoch is one of the quintessential 24-hour Austin coffee shops, so you can imagine plenty of late nights that I've spent here. The indoor space actually isn't particularly large, but there's way more outside seating than Bennu - a blessing when the weather is cooperating; a curse at most times of the year.  I'm not the biggest fan of Epoch's drinks, but I have to give it up for the Mexican chocolate mocha - that hint of spiciness really makes a memorable drink that outclasses plenty of other coffee shops' drinks.  The atmosphere at Epoch is actually quite conducive to studying; in the multiple times that I've been, the music wasn't too overbearing, but there have been occasions that it gets a little too rowdy - no worries, pop your headphones on/in, and you'll be good to go. Parking is ok; when the lot is full, it's a sign that inside will be crammed, too.  Of course, since Epoch is 24/7, the shop will get pretty packed, and the wifi is periodically not-so-good, which could probably contribute to productivity. I still prefer Bennu, but I've spent some great nights at Epoch, and that Mexican chocolate mocha - let me tell you, it puts up a fight. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 11/23/2014 51 check-ins I love coffee. All coffee. Cheap coffee, fancy coffee. French press and 7 Eleven. Epoch is not about the coffee. It is about the coffee house. Their coffee is fine, I usually get a black eye, but don't go for the coffee. Don't go for the food -- excluding the bageldogs, I often kick my morning off with them. But really you go for more than acceptable coffee and over-salted snacks.  Go for the Austin. Epoch is often what Austin is. Youngish, energetic/caffeinated, high speed internet, listening to music that you haven't heard of and reading books that seem deep, or are required by UT courses.  Epoch has flaws -- but go get some caffeine, take a book that makes you look interesting and people watch your afternoon away. Graffiti at epoch. Epoch set up, red eye, bagel dog and code. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/7/2015 3 check-ins This is a fun place to sit back, have a beverage, browse the net and hipster watch. I really enjoy the collection of people that congregate here, it makes the place vibrant and unique. It's not at all like a sterile coffee shop trying to be cool (rhymes with Barstucks)  This place is the real deal. It's next to a great vintage clothing and record shop too, so plan on spending some time in the area. The parking can get a little hectic at busy times, but that's just part of the charm. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 4/17/2016 My husband and I have started coming here every weekend. Their coffee is amazing. I love iced coffee, but I like to sweeten it myself; they have simple syrup out for use so I get it PERFECT EVERY TIME!  Free wifi and plugs hang from the ceiling--this place rocks. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/16/2015 1 check-in Listed in Austin Cafes Epoch is an ideal place to take out-of-towners for a taste of Austin's coffee culture. The patio is vibrant, the crowd is super interesting and friendly, and the drinks are tasty. I will say that even though it has tons of seating/outlets and is open late night, I wouldn't recommend it for getting work done. Especially if you're like me and can't focus when the table next to you is playing Cards Against Humanity and/or AC/DC is playing in the background. (This exact scenario happened to me last winter when I made the mistake of trying to study for a final here on a Friday night. Lolz.)  So for after hours study sesh, Bennu is definitely a better bet. But if you want to hang out with friends on a Friday night like a normal person, this is about as good as it gets. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/6/2013 1 check-in Epoch is a great place to study, read, or just have coffee. The atmosphere is very relaxed. I came here with a friend to study and stayed here for plenty of hours.  Pros: Great atmosphere, good location (close to campus), has plugs located through out the cafe, great selection of coffees and pastries (better than bennu in my opinion).  On my first trip here I asked the cashier if she would recommend for a drink for me, I was looking for something cold and sweet, she suggested the Mojo (only available at Epoch) and even gave me a sample. It was the perfect blend between something coffee/mocha/sweet, I loved it and it is go to drink every time. The ice they use in the drinks is the perfect, it has a texture between shaved and crushed ice.  They have a very nice selection of pastries, and I would have to recommend the cinnamon roll. It is the BEST cinnamon roll I have ever had, imagine a croissant with cinnamon sugar in-between its layers then rolled up, baked to perfection, topped with just the right amount of icing and then some. If you get the cinnamon roll be sure to ask them to heat it up or your experience will just not be the same.  They also allow you to keep an open tab at the cashier as long as you give them your card to hold on as collateral, just make sure you close your tab before 24 hours or else they will charge a 10% tip on top of your tab.  Cons: They keep their air condition on and running, this place is COLD, make sure you bring a jacket or your will end up freezing your pants off. (I love the cold, this place is even cold in my standards, but I like the cold, still bring a jacket). There is a smell in the restrooms that personally I have a hard time getting over. It smells, used and dirty, not to mention there is graffiti all over the walls, and not very stylish graffiti if I might add. Parking kinda sucks, but then again it sucks at almost every 24 hour place, on the upside I was able to find parking here a lot easier than at Bennu.  Overall, this is my new goto study spot around UT and will be coming very often. Best cinnamon roll ever! Make sure you ask to have it warmed up! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee , 8/3/2015 Relaxing atmosphere to hand with friends or do some studying. pastries and pizza are very good. There cinnamon bus are great as well.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/6/2016 This was one of the first coffee shops I experienced when I decided to attend school at UT Austin. A friend invited me out to check out the place while he was working on his dissertation. It was within walking distance. It didn't feel like any other coffee establishment I ever visited. Not only are there friendly baristas preparing drinks and food, it had such good vibes to the point where I immediately felt comfortable enough to take a short power nap on the couch next to my friend. I never recalled ever doing that in a public place in my life, and yet I felt so much at home. I was initially surprised by the variety of people you run into at this place. People were taking part in lively discussions and ideas while live music was playing in the background. There were several people playing chess outside. It was very enjoyable. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/18/2016 Overall, this place is awesome. Great coffee, great lattes, plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The reason I am giving them four stars is because smoking is allowed outdoors on the deck. People can sit only two feet away from the entrance and smoke. There is another outdoor section just around the corner that doesn't allow smoking, BUT I personally think they should ban cigarettes on the property altogether. It is not healthy and of course not pleasant to be breathing in secondhand smoke while trying to enjoy your coffee. I hope they will take this in consideration. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 12/13/2014 1 check-in I went to this place before it was cool, just like pretty much everyone else. I also tried the coffee before it was cool, and burned my mouth.

I went inside to get a quick bite to eat, and noticed this shop is very new (I've been to the one in North Austin at The Domain). This is a very nice coffee shop with ample seating and I noticed some working there as well. I wanted to share a review and encourage those visiting downtown for #ACLFest, #SXSW or Austin Convention Center conferences to stop by.

In addition to the 2-top tables that are great for getting work done, there are also three large, family-style tables and a long bar-top, so Apanas is also ideal for groups or dates. The staff are friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. The coffee itself is sourced directly from Nicaragua, where the owner himself traveled and hand-picked the beans. They also offer a selection of cold-pressed juices, craft beers, pastries, and meal items.  The food and drink are top notch quality. The staff are wonderful. If you're looking for a quiet and open coffeeshop to study, a small meeting place, or an unassuming beer, this is your place! ", pos 
Apanas Coffee & Beer ," 9/26/2016 The food for lunch is okay but far from great. To my knowledge they just bring in sandwiches from another Austin eatery and reheat it. The beer selection is craft only and starts at $5-6 per beer. I also tried an iced coffee and it was okay, but very expensive. It was $1.50 more than the same iced coffee at Dominican Jos down the block but half the size. Working nearby, I'm happy that I went to try it out, but now that I've been there twice to get an idea of what it's about, I won't be returning. ", neutral

There are plenty of seats and the bathrooms are CLEAN!!!  The only complaint I have is that the seats aren't cushy like the OG Epoch, they're kinda hard. And it doesn't have nearly as much character as Epoch 1.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/4/2016 1 check-in Perfectly fine coffee shop. The coffee is good, but nothing outstanding. Their Drip of the Day was a bit too watery for me. Had to add a lot of sugar to it. Their mocha was very good though, nice and full-flavored.  The interior was pretty neat. Understated with plenty of seating. Perfect place to be on a chilly, rainy day. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in I'd be wanting to try this spot for a long time and when the opportunity finally presented itself, I eagerly jumped!  After circling the lot a few times for a parking spot, I contemplated if this was worth a to-go latte, but I was determined. The coffee shop is tucked away in The Village shopping center with the hellish aforementioned parking lot of customers of all the various business competing for a spot.  Already a little defeated by the time I entered Epoch, I was welcomed by a relaxing atmosphere with a ton of seating options. I immediately realized it was a coffee shop really designed for people looking to plug-in and get some serious work done. They even have a nice patio in the back to take your work outside. If I have a long work day in the future, I'll know to go here to get in the zone, however for a casual meet-up, this might not be your place.  While there's definitely not a sense of urgency with the wait staff, it was more the lack of customer service that left a little more to be desired for me. In addition, compared to the standard sizes seen elsewhere in coffee shops, the large was more like a small. ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Cute place. Try the Mojo iced coffee... bomb.com. Plenty of indoor space: tables, bar seating and sofas. There's a quaint little outdoor seating area out back-- a portion of the outdoor space is covered. As far as the service, eh... it's not the best; friendly, but a bit slow to acknowledge their customers, which was a bit awkward to experience and to watch. All in all, Epoch is a pretty good coffee spot. I'd return for the Mojo. Chai Chai and mojo ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 8/3/2016 I'm not sure what it is about this place, but I feel like every time I step foot in it I am being silently judged by the baristas, like they don't think I'm jiggy-enough-with-it to be in their presence. I also think it's strange they only have 2 or so latte flavors... the first time I visited I desperately scanned their tiny menu for even a hint of options, but alas, vanilla it was.  I can't quite explain it, just something about the vibe here makes me wanna whip my phone out and Google Map other coffee shops. ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 2/4/2016 8 check-ins Listed in Austin Espresso Essentials Epoch has a wonderful hipster vibe to it - great ambience and really chill, friendly workers. They also have a wide menu - pour over, drip, cold brew, and espresso coffee drinks as well as a number of teas. The staff is also very helpful, answering questions any customers may have, and are easy to converse with.  I ordered a simple latte, and sat at the bar, but there is a wide range of seating from couches to small tables. Their espresso has a wonderful bitter coffee taste - super satisfying. I will warn that if you prefer sweeter drinks, you may want to order something with an added flavor of some kind. I've also heard their french press is great, but haven't tried it yet.  It's the perfect spot to catch up with friends or work. I'll come here again if I'm ever in North Austin! Latte + Vanilla Latte ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/29/2016 3 check-ins This location is on par with it's OG location (North Loop) it terms of drinks and the atmosphere is pretty good. I really love that they serve hot tea pots here. But I have a few issues:  1. The food. They have a decent kitchen just sitting there. When they first opened they used to make snacks and this was awesome! Now, the food and selection is sub par and unappetizing -- everything is prepackaged and brought in. The OG location does this too but they have way better vendors.  2. The hours. They used to be open until midnight but now close at 10pm. I hate this especially since the other location is 24 hours. While I don't think this location should be open 24 hours, I'm not sure why they're closing so early when the place is still really busy at 10pm. Bring back later hours... 12pm Thursday, Friday, Sat? Makes sense being next to Alamo Draft House.  3. The music. It's way too loud most of the time. I just heard a lady say ""it's too loud in here I can't hear you let's go outside"". The baristas often have the music BLASTING to where you will have a hard time hearing the person in front of you. I can't think. Don't even try talking a call inside... They also play weird shit. Play something your general customer population will enjoy, I'm not into your 80s metal. *** As I am writing this! A second group of moved out side ""is it quite out there?"" *** ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 7/31/2016 The coffee at this place is tricky, because once you come here, you might compare the taste of coffee at other shops and it wont do it for you.  The first time you try their iced latte with a shot of vanilla and sweetened to perfection, you will never feel the same euphoric feeling again, and its kind of a bummer.    But its better to have had this just once in your life then never again.  Oh and every time I go there, the baristas are very nice.  You never get the coffee snob vibe, which personally turns me off to some coffee shops. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/16/2016 This place has great coffee and pastries.  However, it's hit or miss with the baristas.  Some are lovely and friendly, others are typical hipster with an attitude.

I heard the modem times when trying to connect (older folks know what I'm talking about). Anyway, there's no problem with connectivity at Epoch. Plus, the bartenders are super friendly.

Epoch Coffee ," 9/1/2015 1 check-in I really liked the original Epoch location near airport blvd. I have good memories there, drinking coffee with my friends and eating good pasteries. I saw this new location when I was going to Madam mam's for lunch and instrantly I kenw that that is the place that I would like to go for a cup of coffee after the lunch.  I like this place, the atmosphere, and nice people working there. Everyhing should be above four strats. Except, the taste of coffee. I am not a coffee expert so my taste toward coffee may be very particular. I like dark french roast but when I tried the ""regular"" drip coffee. It was very sour. I know some coffee beans (or the type of roasting) have sour flavor but that's not the style of coffee that I prefer. So this review may be very skewed.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/21/2016 Another good coffee shop in Austin... I'm really amazed at how many places in this city are on point with their espresso. This location is tidy and comfortable. A good balance between shops that are so minimalistic you feel like you are in a museum art piece, and the places that feel like they haven't been cleaned in a dozen years. Like most places, I try an Americano the first time I stop in and unlike many places the Americano was perfect. I could imagine this place is slammed on the weekends given the location but I came in on a Monday afternoon. Plenty of seats taken by people with laptops and tablets, but still more than adequate seating.  Barista's seemed chill and friendly enough for me. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 6/15/2015 1 check-in I agree with the general star rating for this location... Call me picky! and I am when it comes to my coffee... :D especially if they set my expectations for good coffee, and especially if they have some good tools to make it... Also I expect that hip vibe from the place, stylish cups and warm welcome environment. Epoch disappointed on a few of those parameters... The space is large, but lacks style and atmosphere, feels like an old sandwich shop that was rented for, what I expected to be, a great coffee shop.  Now, my cappuccino... It's espresso and foam, people! A lot of foam (not macchiato) and not much milk (not a latte). It looked pretty, but was all milk inside... Sight... May be their sandwiches are great... And the Internet is pretty fast. So, may be I will be back, just make sure to have lower expectations... They still have better coffee than Starbucks, don't get me wrong :) ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/6/2016 I ordered the vanilla almond milk latte and fell in love. It's everything a latte should be . Light fluffy and (for me) perfectly sweet. They make their own syrups in house. The vanilla doesn't overwhelm coffee instead complementing it with every sip. The environment is perfect if you want to come study in a cool , laid back atmosphere.

Epoch Coffee ," 7/20/2014 4 check-ins I have held off on reviewing this place as I am very torn between three or four stars.  I have landed on three as I have come here several times, and have always taken my coffee away, as I am never compelled to stay here.  The coffee and staff are great, but cleanliness and ambiance are lacking.  My favorite is the cold brew coffee (sourced from Texas coffee roasters).  Their espresso is also tasty (sourced by Cuvee).  By the afternoon the pastries are limited and look stale, there is a small kitchen that serves up East End pies, and some interesting sounding food bowls and sandwiches.  Not really any fast take away gluten free options. The comfortable couch section off to the side looks dank and dirty sometimes, and just a hint too dark.  The rest of the seating area is cleaner, and they do have a nice small outside patio when the weather is right.  What is up with the ladies bathroom?  The door is still missing, and the useable stall looks like it was cleaned several weeks ago.    I also like that this place is open till 12 am, which makes a quick take away coffee before heading to a late night Alamo movie convenient See all photos from Mindy H. for Epoch Coffee ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/14/2015 1 check-in On convenience, really good wireless connectivity. friendliness ...they are really really good, but if rating them on coffee...it is definitely meh.  But then not everyone is obsessed about that kind of stuff like me.  And when I say coffee ...I don't mean a latte, but a pour over or do a espresso. They guys have a pretty expensive machine to pull espressos, let they are always a let down with a very thin watery to non-existent crema, pour overs are done so hurriedly that once does not really get the full extraction of flavor for what otherwise should be a great cup of coffee coming from Cuvee.  On the other side of coin is easy accessibility, really good connection speeds, reasonable service and fairly helpful staff then ends up with this place being A-OK. A fairly pedestrian espresso. ..no discernable crema ", neutral 
Epoch Coffee ," 5/7/2016 Since all of my other reviews on Yelp tend to be complaints (sorrynotsorry) I thought I'd give a shout out to one of my favorite spots to quaff caffeine and work. The staff is friendly, kind, and  quick, the atmosphere is chill and has the paradoxical feel of an industrial space that is also and inviting. The coffee is strong and ethically sound, they have a small but decent selection of GF snacks, and even though sometimes it gets so crowded I've walked in and turned right back around to leave, mostly there is room at the inn. Their pretty authentic, homemade chai is the perfect combination of flavorful and potent but not too sweet. If you're used to a super sugary chai you might look elsewhere. I only wish they stayed open later here, like their rougher-around-the-edges sibling on North Loop. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/27/2015 I love this place. I've been going for around a year and a half now and it is my go-to spot. The atmosphere is awesome and great for getting work done. It's also very chill, so showing up in the evening to chat with friends or work on group projects is fun, but the best part about Epoch is the baristas. They make an effort to know your name and have conversations with you and all are very friendly and offer suggestions if you're looking for something new to drink. The music selection kind of goes everywhere, but I kind of like it. It's never the same thing. They even offer a place to display art and don't take a cut if you sell anything. The coffee is also very good after they changed to a new brand a few months ago.  I think the only reason I have to not give 5 stars is that the internet is finicky at best and doesn't work at all at worst. It seems to work best in the mornings when very few people are in, but you start jumping between their two routers around noon and into the evening. I wouldn't say much about it except it is kinda of a 'working' coffee-shop, and if I KNOW I need internet that day for a client, I have to pass and go somewhere I know I won't get dropped or work from home.  All that being said, this is still my #1 place to go in Austin. Great atmosphere, very relaxing and not too loud so I can concentrate on what I'm doing or hear a conversation I am having with a friend. Keep up the good work guys! ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 10/11/2015 I've been a regular at Epoch for a little over a year now. I keep coming back because the atmosphere is chill, the house-made chai is good, and the baristas are friendly and knowledgeable.  Yes, the music selection is quirky-sometimes they play a little too much Kate Bush or have an odd mix going on in the background-but it's rarely too distracting for getting work done.  They're working on being more personable by asking names and having more conversations with customers, and most of their baristas are coming from other coffee shops around town.  I haven't yet had a reason not to return. The plentiful parking and convenient north location are also big wins. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee , 1/15/2016 1 check-in Great place to come off of Anderson Lane. I live in the neighborhood so I come here all the time. Great place to drink coffee and hang out with friends. Small and intimate area but nice courtyard in the back to move around. , pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 3/20/2014 Updated review 6 check-ins This was my favorite new discovery, but sadly it did not last. Parking had always been awful, but there has not been any seating the last two times I've gone in and prices were just increased $0.50 for all drinks (except the cortado, I think). I know $0.50 isn't a lot, but the original prices were already higher than Starbucks and I don't feel like Epoch deserves any slack for mispricing when they have had another store open for years to experiment with. Also, my usual cappuccino had always been served in their bigger cups (about 12 oz) and they just recently downsized all drinks (except mochas, as far as I can tell) to their small cups (about 8 oz).  Updated prices, for reference:  Cappuccino: $3.25 to $3.75 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Latte: $3.50 to $4.00 (Starbucks Tall = $2.75) Mocha: $3.75 to $4.25 (Starbucks Tall = $3.25) Drip: $2.00 to $2.50 (Starbucks Tall = $1.65)  If you're rich and willing to pay a buck more for less coffee, of course Epoch tastes better. But if you're a poor student like me, back across the street to Starbucks it is... New menu as of 05/06/14, but careful because it'll probably be completely different tomorrow ", neutral

Epoch Coffee ," 10/15/2015 BIG THANKS to Britt @ Epoch Coffee for introducing San Francisco's most delicious coffee roaster, Ritual Coffee Roasters, to The Great State of Texas!!  This coffee is so delish it doesn't need cream and it sure as heck doesn't need sugar. It's delicious all until itself and Britt made sure Epoch Coffee serves it daily. They also sell it by the package to enjoy at home.  Ritual was started in the heart of the Mission district in San Francisco by Eileen Hassi in 2005. I remember when I worked at Flora Grubb Gardens Eileen teaching me about coffee flavors and roasting while she hand stamped her paper cups with a rubber stamp.

Epoch Coffee ," 12/18/2013 118 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black This new Anderson Epoch bears the same resemblance with its North Loop sibling as I have with my own sister - absolutely none. I should probably disclose I don't actually have a sister.  And since we're in disclosing mode, let me mention my coffee consumption has gone from two quarts a day to less than two cups, because it's my worst trigger for smoking ever. The point being nothing pisses me off quicker these days than tepid swill posing as coffee. That puts me in a really really, dark place.     I'm happy to report this new Epoch is all sunshine and rainbows. Their $2 house pour using my cup was wonderful. They have Russell's pastries, a real kitchen from 10am-2pm, and WiFi blazing at 10m-down. A laid-back & friendly staff who appear to enjoy working there. And granted this place is brand-spanking new, but it's so clean and sterile here that you can literally do coffee bean surgery right off the floor. If you want to feel personality, head over to the North Loop Epoch, you'll have to give this Anderson Epoch a little more time to develop.    The bottom line is let's see how they fare, with Starbie's around the corner and Genuine Joe's up the street. Maybe they're shooting for the post-Alamo crowd, or the Anderson Lane lunch-hoppers. Maybe if you build it, they will come. I do know this new Epoch has good coffee and it's a pleasant respite. In this particular hip & cool gentrified section of town, it's almost quietly epic. No particular reason why I like this pic, I just do. Okay, I like playing with contrasts & angles. They make a pretty cortado here for $3. Awww, coffee art.

Epoch Coffee ," 1/24/2016 This is one of the better executed coffee shops that we have visited in Austin. There is plenty of seating, different types of seating, spread out, outdoor even. The music is loud enough to blend the noises but not enough to take over your brain. We can't speak to the coffee. For us, coffee is either drinkable or not: it was fine. We didn't try the wifi which is normally important to us but other reviewers said it is fine. The only suggestion is to integrate some textile into the decor to absorb some of the background noise given all of the hard surfaces. ", pos

Freakin baby cup gave me the shakes at 11:30pm and now I can't wait to go back. It also didn't help that I chased that down with their tea. Ben was such a sweetheart and told us he would do a second steeping on our tea. I loved everything about this place and can't wait to visit again.

Answered all our questions and treated each customer before us, to include us, like we were friends.  Small conversation and just being genuinely nice.    Cappuccino was apparently the best one my g/f had ever experienced.  I had a blood orange tea that was unique and delicious.  I really like that they fill their own tea bags.  The set up is made for studying, so if you want to have a conversation, it's a bit awkward, but not that bad.  They have some table games and couch/lounge areas to be a bit more secluded and play games. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 7/9/2014 Updated review I like Epoch coffee still. Clean lines, fast wifi, great A/C, new outside seating. I haven't resampled food and I'm not going to buy those pastries sitting there since 8am.  Here's the gig though. It's been 7 months and that bathroom is still a broken down mess. The door to the second stall is still off. The towel dispenser is hanging open like a gaping maw with sodden roll of towel on top. The one bathroom that does function has grimy floors and the TP is off the roll sitting on the handicap bar.  There are 30 people in here and one lonely barista trying to do it all which makes wait times long and her life miserable (I'm sure.) I expect some of these things at the old location which is arguably less put together but I thought they'd fix some of these things in the half year they've been open. ", neutral

Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot.

I have to say their iced coffee is good, albeit a little on the acidic side (which is somewhat typical in cold brews anyway).   They make amaaaaazing espresso -- very smooth and drinkable.  People who work here seem decent and knowledgable.  I haven't ever had an issue I needed resolved, so I'm not entirely sure how they handle that sort of thing.  Prices are a couple quarters more than I would expect on most drinks.  Nice chill vibe in the shop, and lots of seating.  Girl's bathroom is really spacious and clean.

There's lots of comfortable seating: several couches, lots of tables for working, and a patio out back.

Epoch Coffee ," 5/10/2015 The drinks here are pretty top notch, especially if you consider your options in the area. Usually they only have one person working up front, which for me is fine, never the impatient one.  Russell's pastry's are offered from the front counter which I've never been a fan of, but this review is based solely on the coffee & the service I've received. Not sure why people are annoyed that they sit out all day. I've worked at many places that sell pastries (including whole foods) if you think they are being rotated out in an hourly basis, you're not very food smart..  I usually order a cortado & it never really disappoints. Texas coffee traders is served for ice coffee instead of the cuvée that is used for espresso. I love TCT & wish they would be able to shine a bit more in Austin. The tea selection here is pretty good, I get the white blueberry iced sometimes, haven't been to very many places that offer fancy teas, cooled.  The only thing that bugs me is the barista will often ignore me when I'm next in line & loudly chat to a friend that has walked in behind me. Usually the friends order is taken first & then I'm left with a smug, ""what can I get you?"" I know this isn't the owner, who is kinda quiet, which doesn't bother me. Just something that irks me.. I'm a regular, but not a stay too long chatty kind of person. This of course doesn't deter me from coming back, just an excuse for a soul eye roll.  All in all I really like the vibe of this place, it's always really clean, the music is perfect in the AM, the coffee is delicious & they have a good patio in the back. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 2/19/2014 3 check-ins Listed in 2014 Yelp 100 Challenge, West Anderson? Best Anderson., The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Let me tell you a thing - this place is just the cutest. Everybody already knows that I have a favorite coffee shop in Austin, but I decided that I could have a south Austin favorite and a north Austin favorite, but the south Austin favorite is still number one. Wait, maybe they can be tied for first because I don't want either of them to feel second best.  It doesn't matter what time of day I come here - the staff members are just straight up adorable. They ask you about your day and they care about your answer; heck, they'll even have a full on conversation with you! The standard, ""Hi, how are you?"" is not just an automated response here; it's a genuine question backed by real curiosity. Call me a sucker for human warmth, but, well... okay, I'm just a sucker for that kind of thing. (When I worked in retail, I tried to do the exact same thing because seeing someone's face light up when they see that you are actually engaging them as a person instead of treating them as yet another customer is positively wonderful. It's the little things that matter most, you know?)  They serve Cuvée coffee here, which is my favorite type of coffee and pretty much the only coffee I will drink. I went from never drinking coffee to only drinking one specific brand of coffee. My brain is so silly sometimes. The one time I ordered a hot chocolate, I asked if they could sprinkle cinnamon on the top because that is my favorite way to drink hot chocolate, and they informed me that they use a Mexican chocolate that already has cinnamon in it. They did not lie and that hot chocolate just might be my favorite hot chocolate in Austin.  Then there's the story of how I went on one of the cutest first dates ever - I suggested Epoch because it was centrally located to my office and his apartment. As we were ordering, I mentioned that this was our first date and the barista said, ""No way. You're kidding, right?"" I laughed and told him, no, I was not kidding. ""I never would have guessed. It seems like you two have known each other for forever."" I took this as a good sign since I had literally met this guy not one minute before that exchange.  The date went very well and we stayed there chatting for some time. At some point, maybe two hours in, the same barista walks to our table with a slice of cheesecake and says, ""Because it seems like your first date is going well."" My heart melted right then and there. How thoughtful is that? He brought us a slice of cheesecake because our date was going well. I just can't get over how sweet that gesture was.  I just can't even with how cute this place is and how warm and fuzzy it makes me feel inside. Everyone here is so thoughtful and kind and genuine and there's something about that that I just love. I live for those connections, however small, because it's those connections that keep us all going at the end of the day, and any place that makes my inner social worker sing has found a forever fan in me.

I still don't know what it is, so don't ask me.  This is another version of the ever so popular, open 24 hour coffee shop on North Loop. This one is not open 24/7, they have human hours.  I like this new location. Its in the Village Shopping Center (near the Alamo DH). The inside needs help. It doesn't feel like a coffee shop. It needs some pizzazz! Something to set it apart. But there is plenty of seating which the other location will never have due to its proximity to campus. They also have a small kitchen, therefore a lot more options for food here. An outside patio is available for smokers and nice weather observers.  On a strange and sadder note: To add to Kelly S's review, the women's restroom is the saddest restroom I've ever seen. There is one stall, and the 2nd one has no door on it. The bathroom reminds me of a bare, sad hospital bathroom. They don't even have good hand soap. They've got that 99cent shit from HEB in there.

The drip coffee is cheap, and refills are only $1. The mocha here is still good, but you can only go Mexican mocha. The beloved mojo is still here as well. They've got solid food menu (from what it seems), but  it's only available until 3pm.  Big space. Most tables are only for two people, so it's not great for big groups.

I love a reasonably quiet place to work and chat. This Epoch new location hits all of those on the nose.  My soy latte was so delicious- really really good espresso, creamy milk- that I didnt even need sugar ( and that's saying a lot for me.)  The only downside. It's already way too popular. The line to get coffee stretched around the bar and halfway to the door. We waited about 45 mins before daring to get in line. Also ( and I am sure its because they are new) they were out of almost everything- mocha syrup, decaf beans ( mine was the last.) Being popular can have its downsides sometimes, but I am sure that it will work out the kinks for the future. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 12/20/2013 21 check-ins ROTD 4/28/2014 This review isn't really fair.   I feel like Epoch Coffee moved into this W. Anderson location because I WILLED it to happen.  The cosmos knew I wanted an excellent cafe in the empty space next to our office, and they made it happen.    I couldn't be happier.  First, I appreciate the design/layout.  They leased a long, narrow, weird-shaped, old space and made it BEAUTIFUL.   This is not an easy feat.  I know, I tried to do the same with our office location.  You can tell that the design was very well thought out.  Lots of warm woods, excellent lighting, art on the walls, and seating that satisfies the hard-working lone-wolf and the socialite.    I really love the ordering area.  The minimal aesthetic brings the focus to what they do best: coffee.   They have pour-overs, several selections of beans and grinds, and (the pièce de résistance) the incredible Strada espresso machine.   If you are a coffee connoisseur, you won't be disappointed.    As for the food, I am thrilled.  I like to eat healthy.  Our office is surrounded by some of the best food in Austin (Bartletts, Phonatic, Hopdoddy, Verts etc) but we don't have a lot of healthy alternatives.  Last time I ate at Epoch, I had an incredible Vegan Club sandwich.  It is very cool that a place that specializes in coffee can make food this good.  Most importantly, the people there are awesome.  Everyone on our team loves going to Epoch and talking to their team.   They like great music, they know coffee, and they are extremely friendly.   I am big fan, and I will be in Epoch often.

Epoch Coffee ," 3/17/2014 I live right by the original Epoch on North Loop. It's typically packed - as is Monkey Nest - so it's good to see another coffee shop open up in the area. I hope that this will provide some much needed relief.  It's a fairly small place, but the space is well utilized. Couches at the front provide lots of seating for socialization. Along the side wall is a row of two-seater tables good for those on a date or (as most people were) working on laptops. There are about three 4-seater tables in the back. It also seemed that they had a back patio.  Small selection of pastries from Russell's bakery. They also have a kitchen that makes sandwiches and salads from 10-2.  Service was good, coffee is what you expect. Overall, I'm very happy this place opened up here. ", pos

Epoch Coffee ," 1/16/2014 1 check-in I did a happy dance when the permit went up for Epoch many months ago because we could really use a non-chain coffee purveyor with good hangout space on Anderson Lane. (Yes, I know Genuine Joe's is just down the road, but it has heating/cooling issues and you roll the dice on surly service each and every time.)  I finally paid Epoch a visit and am pleased. It's the brighter, cleaner cousin to the original outpost on North Loop. You'll still have a smattering of hipsters and quite a few gamers, but they peaceably coexist alongside solo students with their noses in books and chatty friends catching up on their week. There are tables, benches, sofas, comfy chairs, plentiful outlets...something for everyone.  Unlike a previous reviewer who found the service abrasive, I was struck by how friendly the barista and the fellow who gave me the wi-fi password were. I enjoyed my piping hot, cinnamon-y mocha so much that I also sipped away on my husband's when he declared his too strong. The only hiccup was the temperature of the building. Um, was that my breath I just saw? It was really freakin' cold. (And that says a lot, coming from someone who typically runs hot). Oh, and as others have mentioned, it's not a great spot for a snack unless you happen to roll in between 10am and 2pm. Huh? I hope they expand their food hours over time.  Despite my quibbles, I'm so glad to have Epoch (aka Circa 13) in the 'hood. ", pos 
Epoch Coffee ," 2/21/2015 11 check-ins My go-to spot for a latte. They really know what they're doing (coffee-wise.) Lattes usually include a beautiful latte-art design for your (brief) viewing pleasure before you happily drink it down. When the weather is warm, get an iced mojo. Creamy and sweet iced coffee that's gotten me through quite a few study sessions. If super sweet is not your thing, order a half iced mojo. Food- they usually have a fairly good selection of pastries, although they're in this weird, very low-to-the-ground glass case that's built into the counter (can anyone explain to me what's up with that? You're selling scones, not diamond earrings) I digress.. If you need something more substantial to snack on, they sell pizza by the slice from Eastside Pies (try the circa! Feta. Broccoli. Sweet potato. Strange yet oh-so delicious.)  My ONLY reason for not giving these guys five stars is the customer service. It's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ", pos

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/27/2016 2 check-ins Listed in ""Nuptial Coffee Bliss!"", Anderson Lane is the new Black Oh hey, the pro vs con format. I've never used that before. Let's try it:  Pros: 1. This place is cooler than I thought. 2. It's open until 2am. No, really. 3. They have beer & wine. I didn't know that until I saw the beer taps. They offered me a sample.  Cons: 1. If you have to describe The Factory with one word, it probably won't be ""inexpensive.""  I don't think they're shooting for the ""Sixth Coffeehouse on Anderson Lane but with Flash"" title here, I think they really want to be the official bistro in the neighborhood - far more casual than Bartlett or Hopdoddy, but with a lot more flair than Tea Haus or Starbuck Evenings. Staying open until 2am is a good start, and let's see if they add more to the menu. Remember, no one thought that gentrified Walmart would do well either.  In the meantime, have fun with those chicken & waffles, and their colorful matcha-infused coffees. I'm only interested in straight black, and their pourover Stumptown is great stuff. Try the $5 pop tart at least once, mainly because you can. And then let's meet back here in a couple of weeks, just to see what's been tweaked. This place defines hipster man-cave. I liked the long table with 1/2 bar chairs & stools, & the cool plates & cups. There's a $5 pop tart. ", pos

I finally found a coffee shop I can study at without sacrificing comfort (Starbucks' uncomfortable chairs). The coffee shop endorses social connection, hence, wifi  isn't available. It makes me really happy that a lot of students hang out here with their book bags and laptops and we can all just study in peace and somehow quiet (the background music can get pretty loud). Unfortunately, there will always be that kid who's obnoxiously loud and would like the whole world to know her business. Seriously, unless it's something intriguing or educational, no one cares. In addition, as much ""fun"" as this place looks, it's not child friendly. So parents, make sure your children do not hit the table in front of it and knock out the chess set. Lastly, the sex images in the bathrooms are definitely not appropriate for children.  The ambiance is very much like Austin-- very eccentric and hip! Food and drink presentations are on par. Drink prices are reasonable and similar to good ole Starbucks. But unlike you're typical coffee shop, they have real food such as chicken and waffles.  My favorite about this place is the cleanliness. The employees do a good job maintaining the place. Also, as I watch them make coffees, they do it with fines as if they're creating some type of art, it's pretty cool (in my opinion).  In conclusion, Cafe w/ a Soul is probably the best coffee shop I've ever been to. It's like studying in my own home but away from distractions. I'm awake!

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/25/2016 1 check-in Ok, let's try this approach...  Pros: Music Seating Decor General ambiance Service  Cons: iPad ordering (I'm a crotchety old man, kids) Limited coffee menu, or menu in general Relatively expensive Food is pretty but lackluster  I'm still sitting here as I type this and I'm less than overjoyed with the experience, sadly. The space and vibe are great but not quite familiar or intimate enough to beat out a place like Genuine Joe down the street. It seems like they bank on the vibe, and fall short the rest of the way. (This would be a great hangout for the artsy/design crowd having a collaborative meeting.)  The staff is great but the iPad ordering system limits your required interaction with them. They take pride in no wifi to increase interaction but then use iPads instead of people?  Seating is ample, if cramped in a surprisingly large space.  But the food, kids. So pretty, but again lackluster. I tried the Pop+art ($5) and the Nutella Waffle ($4.75) and they both sit on their respective tiny awkward plates half eaten. (Yes the plate liners are cute) The waffle is a great idea but the waffle itself  has no flavor and there's no delight. The tart is similar - the pastry crust is much too thick compared to the Smuckers jam tasting filling and it is essentially just pure sugar. The pastry itself doesn't even taste buttery or crisp. Meh. There appears to be no soul in this confectionary.  Coffee- passable. But at $4 for a cortado and a $1.50 up-charge for almond milk- I'll pick another place.  I get why the reviews are so good here, but there are much better places nearby for that ""cafe with a soul"" feel. This feels like an ACL pop-up. Going for that?  Great, come here.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/17/2016 1 check-in Listed in 2016 - The Third Time is a Charm! The Factory has A+ decor and a very innovative interactionless (tablet) ordering system. This allows you to look up what to get without feeling pressured by a barista staring at you waiting for you to order. The eclectic selection of tables, couches, and swings (?!) inside with a small kiddy corner appeal to many different types of tastes. This is seriously a cool place to hang out.  However, when it comes to the coffee and food, it's rather not cheap. The waffles range from $4-$8, and coffee is between $3.50 and $5. The quality of the coffee is not yet up to par with other coffee mainstays in Austin, so I would probably not choose to come here just for coffee.

I didn't want to tell anyone how awesome The Factory - Cafe With a Soul is because I don't want it overrun and super busy with no place to sit like so many other decent coffee shops in Austin. I happened to come in here with a friend mid-week and we sat here for several hours, enjoying the peace and quiet, the atmosphere, and the awesome coffee.  This place is a little eclectic - lots of peculiar art, books, games, knick-knacks, and an almost head-scratching drink and food menu. Waffles and pop tarts...and beer? And... coffee mojitos? Well, it works. Whatever is going on here, it works fabulously. They serve Stumptown Coffee, which as someone from the Northwest, I totally appreciate. They also brew coffee correctly. There is not a hint of bitterness or overcooked milk going on here. The iPad ordering screens are mostly cool, (although they need more options for customization) and the million different types of seating, (couches, pillows, swings, big chairs, little chairs, bar seating, regular tables) is both delightful and refreshing. The baristas make foam art - something that I have only seen at Houndstooth here in Austin.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 10/12/2016 1 check-in Checked out The Factory this past Sunday with my husband. We wanted to try their delicious looking waffles and were definitely not disappointed.  Husband ordered an iced coffee drink that was delicious, but it wasn't as good as my Golden Age of Milk Tea, well worth the 10 minute wait for the tea to steep.  We both ordered the Nutella Waffle and it was perfect. From the wood plate with the AMAZING paper liner printed with a famous person and an inspirational quote from them. I wanted just the paper because it was so cute and well done. The waffle is basically half a waffle, spread with Nutella and a layer of bananas, then folded in half. While small, it was a perfect amount, the bananas balancing out the sweetness of the Nutella. The waffle itself was crisp perfection, providing a crunch to the meal. The menu is very limited: there was the nutella waffle and a fried chicken waffle. I'm hoping they'll eventually serve other waffles, but totally respect their decision to start small.  The space is gorgeous. From the swings to the mural above the bar, everything looks meticulously planned out. And here is where my biggest advice comes: this place is really not for kids. The way the seating is set up is really for larger people and there is definitely no place for high chairs. While there is giant magnetic poetry on one of the columns, a crazy chair outside and a couple of table games, the giant chess set looks risky for grabby kids. If you have a well-behaved child who can handle it, I would think its fine. However, I watched several families come in and either leave or order to go, commenting it wasn't the best space for them. While this doesn't bother me (I love kidless spaces), it might be jarring to someone expecting to have brunch with the family.  I am so excited to become a regular here! Great new spot! ", pos

It's super cute and trendy, to the point where it feels kind of out of place in a strip mall. Although I loved the interior design and general ambiance of the place, I was a little disappointed with the menu. This is more of a coffee shop than a cafe - their food options are pretty limited. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and I ordered Nutella waffles with strawberries and bananas. For the price I paid, the portions were definitely on the smaller side.

The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ," 11/2/2016 I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! I only went because I had time to kill and they were the only coffee shop nearby open until 2 am. But I'm so glad I tried it out. It's not your typical Austin coffee shop. The quality of the drinks here was top notch, and they offer unique food and drinks. I had the macha latte (I think that's what it was called) and it was fantastic! The people were so friendly, the decor was beautiful, with plenty of comfortable seating (including swings from the ceiling!), and it was just the perfect place to chill with friends. I'll definitely be coming back! ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/18/2016 1 check-in Cool, smooth, hipster coffee in Austin.  As customary to any vacation we go on, I try to find a hipster coffee place to go to- mostly because, well, I like my coffee (I think someday, it may give me an ulcer, but until then, I'll continue to drink it.)  After spending a few hours in the Texan sun (which definitely drained me), a nice cup of refreshing coffee sounded good.  We stopped by Houndstooth- a modern hipster place. I got the Japanese style iced coffee- I've had it before, and was pleased that it was offered here.  It was smooth and refreshing- and to my standards, I did not have to add milk/cream of any sort, - meaning the aftertaste was light and worth drinking black.  I'm sure they have even better hot coffees, but it was still a great stop while being in Austin. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/17/2016 1 check-in I absolutely LOVE coffee and I love real coffee. None of that artificial pumpkin spice frap for me. If you enjoy really good coffee and drink lattes or cold brew, then this is the place for you. I ordered a latte and my boyfriend got an iced caffe Americano. Both were amazing!  If you're looking for the location, it is attached to the Frost Bank in Downtown Austin, but there is plenty of room inside to grab a seat, sip on coffee, and browse your computer. The cashier was super friendly and they did have a nice, clean bathroom inside that required a key. Iced latte & Iced caffe Americano. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/14/2016 Houndstooth serves not only amazing coffee, but some tasty breakfast burritos from Tacodeli too. The coffee here is awesome. The Japanese style iced where they brew a single cup over ice may be a bit pricey, but the flavor is just so good. The staff is great as well and super friendly and knows their way around a tasty cup of coffee. The space is pretty open and has good light, so it's a perfect place for doing some work with your coffee. ", pos

The cafe has plenty of room and seating, great vibe and friendly baristas. A cool setting outside the houndstooth to sit and enjoy your coffee.  They have a pretty interesting variety of coffee. We had Cortado and brewed Coffee. Our drinks were well balanced, smooth and delicious . It is  definitely the place for you if you're a coffee snob!  Some of the speciality drinks are pricier.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/29/2016 Love their highly curated tea selection. The hibiscus rooibos is a favorite. Bright, tart, and a little funky.  Also, the baristas are very knowledge and quite friendly.  An extra plus for good wifi, and a very slight minus for a small pastry selection. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/15/2016 It's everything you want in a serious coffee bar. They weigh their shots, they use great quality beans and they've got a selection of pastries or tacos. If you want a real espresso/coffee experience, look no further. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 8/15/2016 As avid coffee drinkers we always appreciate milk steamed to perfection and some smooth, potent espresso. We visited Houndstooth coffee twice on our trip to Austin, and I am very glad we did. We were offered the choice between two different espresso beans when we ordered, and the baristas were always spot on when interpreting and explaining the flavors. We also got the blueberry muffin and the blueberry scone, and they were good! Would highly recommend this coffee place. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee , 9/25/2016 Great coffee - had a couple of well needed quality Macchiatos after several bad brews elsewhere.  Wifi was a little sketchy today but they more than made up for it with a cracking 80/90s playlist that oozed good vibes all afternoon. , pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/6/2015 1 check-in I really want to have liked this place but the coffee just didn't fit my taste.  It's a beautiful and unique cafe nestled under a bank and office building. You can tell that they take their coffee making seriously because I have never seen anyone weight out the exact amount of coffee, time the exact amount of time the coffee should brew, and then serve it to you. Everything was done with so much detail and precision that I thought I would get the best tasting coffee in the world. What I got was definitely rich but it was also really weird. I ordered the Japanese iced coffee and it was like a mix of green tea with coffee. The taste is definitely deep and multi-dimensional but there was a weird after taste. I wish they would develop this into some type of iced latte that is sweeter because I think it was taste a lot better. This is definitely a place for those who appreciate their black and dark, rich coffee. I guess for me, it just didn't hit the spot. Japanese ice coffee ", neutral

We found Houndstooth and well, fate had our cards played right as our Barista's name was... Austin!!! C'mon now, that's pretty amazing! As Austin noticed Roland L's GGET cap, he nervously extracted our espressos expertly. Our Java was quite amazing, smooth and delicious. Why only 4 stars, well, our second trip by a different barista scored a lot lower, more like a 3.5.

Houndstooth Coffee , 1/20/2016 1 check-in This is a nice spot right in downtown Austin.  We were looking for a place to grab a quick cup and relax a bit while we planned out our day.  This hit the spot.  I grabbed a nicely executed pour-over and spent a few minutes chatting with the barista.  He was incredibly friendly and well informed.  I always enjoy talking coffee with other coffee geeks.  I feel like I always learn something.  Prices were right in line with what you'd expect for high end coffee and I would certainly stop back here the next time I am in town. , pos 
Houndstooth Coffee , 7/17/2016 3 check-ins Round 1: The cold brew doesn't really compare in strength or flavor to the one at Ruckus but it was okay.  Round 2: The almond milk latte (while overpriced for 12oz) is superior. , pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/8/2015 1 check-in Listed in Keep Austin Delicious Houndstooth is a bit hard to find due to the address, but once you get there, it's worth it for the well-made coffee as well as to see hipster Austin in action. The entrance is actually on the corner of 4th and Congress. Once you walk in, you see a bunch of artist types on laptops, a large and clean interior, and indie music playing on a countertop speaker. They have all sorts of coffee options as well as breakfast food items. They even do Japanese cold brew, though I went with the regular. They also have a bunch of tea options, if you're into that.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/11/2016 The baristas here are super knowledgeable about coffee.  If I had time to drink-in I would have tried the interesting sounding ginger espresso drink of the day with decaf espresso, but that was a drink-in exclusive and I needed to go to a meeting.  I also asked about their teas but they're mostly high caffeine.  So I went with a decaf latte.  I can respect that some coffee houses want to have only natural sweeteners.  All that they had out was raw sugar.  But, I really need to avoid adding sugar for health reasons, so I would have preferred to have my sweeteners of choice available (Splenda or Stevia).  Since I had no choice I used the sugar and it took a whole lot of raw sugar to sweeten the latte to even a fraction of the sweetness I usually enjoy.  I try not to think of how much sugar that was.  But, it tasted good.  If I lived nearby and could keep a box of splenda on my desk, I'd be happy to get coffee from here again and sweeten it myself.  Unfortunately since I'm only here on business, I'm better off sticking to the generally inferior Starbucks so I can have coffee w/o tons of sugar and have it be at the sweetness that I like. ", pos

My friend's coffee was delightful and I was able to watch my bicycle from the window. (I forgot the key to my bike lock, so that was imperative).

Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/21/2016 1 check-in Very friendly baristas. I had the cold brew, and it was a little weaker than my usual taste, but still greater. The self service station for sugar or milk was very small and only served 1 person at a time. There was not even room to put my coffee down. The station also only has raw sugar, which is great to add to coffee, but does not dissolve at all for colder mixes. Nevertheless, the baristas were very great and refilled the half and half container as soon as they spotted me. She even went looking for me after she refilled it since I returned to my table. I was lucky enough to come before the rush, but the line can be 10-15 people long as quite the wait it seems.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/10/2016 I really like their coffee, so 4 stars there. Delicious. No question at all.  Baristas are nice if you know them. I don't and they are still polite, so we are good there too! In fact we are moving along just fine...  But then, I have a conundrum. Let me set the mood: 9am on a weekday, very few people in line (2 ahead of me, to be exact). The two in front are extremely curious about the menu, the different flavors and options. There is a barista listening to the two chat about the coffee options for the day, and another barista at the register. Today I just wanted tacos. Just a couple of tacos, and I will be on my way. Nothing more. Please PLEASE don't make me wait out these two coffee-curious patrons ahead of me. Please...? So I wander over to the barista at the register thinking I could sneak in a taco-only order. Barista #1 wouldn't allow it. ""Back in line, sir."" Even if the two people in front of you haven't even decided what to get yet, you need to wait. Please, just wait. So I waited. But do I really need to wait? Can we rethink this? Bend the rules a little? Have some compassion and creative thinking beyond the prescribed establishment rules? Maybe...create a taco-only line!? (Go to Black Star Co-op and see how they do it. Brilliant.) At any rate, no notch on the stars for that. It is what it is. Just think there could be improvements there.  It's very expensive. Really good, just very expensive. And no taco line. UGH! I said it again. Sorry. Maybe I am dinging them for that. I am a jerk. And a line cutter. ", neutral

Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/31/2015 I found this place pretty late in my week-long trip to Austin, and I ended up visiting several times. I tried the iced coffee, espresso, and pour-over, and all three were the best I had in Austin.  I'm not sure what brewing method they used for the iced coffee, but it tasted like cold brew -- low in acidity. I liked it significantly better than the one I had at Dominican Joe (which is also a competent coffee shop).  The espresso shot was sweet, and a little tart without getting into the silly levels of sourness that so many 'cool' coffee shops seem so fond of.  The pour-over was a delicious Burundi, roasted by North Carolina's Counter Culture Coffee, and brewed on a Kalita Wave. (The Aeropress madness seems to have mostly bypassed Austin.) This was my favorite of the three drinks.  I did not try the milk drinks, but I did see them make a latte, and the milk appeared to be correctly steamed and poured.  Houndstooth is a multi-roaster cafe; in addition to Counter Culture, I saw beans from PT's Coffee (Kansas), and some Texan roaster whose name escapes me.  In addition to coffee, they have Taco Deli breakfast tacos, the usual coffee shop pastries, and I think I saw loose leaf teas. Prices were maybe a shade higher than similar shops in Seattle, with the espresso shot running closer to $3 than $2.  Note: this place is nearly invisible if you're walking down Congress, unless you're specifically looking for it (which you should be). It's in the southwest corner of the Frost Tower, with the main entrance on Congress, and a side door on 4th. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/16/2015 First time in this coffee place while visiting Austin during SxSW. I ordered an iced coffee, which was a cold brew. The coffee was not too strong with still a slight hint of acidity. Since it was cold brew coffee, it tasted very different from iced coffee prepared in the traditional way with hot water. Give it a try if you want a different experience from regular ice coffee. You may like it.  The barista at the counter was extremely nice and patient when I asked about how the coffee was prepared, etc.  The atmosphere is quite pleasant and relaxing. The place looks spacious with large windows facing the street. You can get a pretty good outside view from the inside. There is also an outside sitting area where you can buy drinks directly. It is a good place to take a break after a nice walk in downtown Austin. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/24/2016 We had a great breakfast here of lattes and breakfast tacos (a la carte from Tacodeli).

Houndstooth Coffee , 4/5/2016 1 check-in So I just started working around the corner from this place and this is my first stop in. When I walked in the place was completely dead two customers at tables. Then I realized that I was walking in to the shop two minutes before they closed. To most establishments this would be an absolute nightmare of a situation. The barista greeted me warmly and very excepting and was more than happy to dirty some of the equipment that was already clean for a customer who was still coming in during business hours.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 12/27/2015 It was ok. Taste was different and a little nutty for my flavor. The atmosphere was a little stale and needs to be broken in a bit. But overall it was pretty good. Better than average, but not 4.5-5 star place just yet. In due time. Definitely better local places to go to. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 4/10/2016 Not as much of a fan as the one on North Lamar. The espresso incredibly acidic, following the unfortunate trend that has arisen third wave coffee shops of late. The Congress location lacks a lot of the soul and character the other location had. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/21/2013 3 check-ins Easy to find once you know it's there, tucked back along the side to the entrance of Frost Bank.  Was excited to see Houndstooth has another location.  I suppose I am a bit of a coffee geek, and Houndstooth knows what they are doing.  They have an extensive training they put their baristas through, and they are very well versed in the beans they have on ""tap"".  True baristas are artists, they really can make a great coffee taste bad if they aren't familiar with the bean and conditions.  I was lucky to be able to join the Coffee Geekery event via Yelp that occurred here.  It was my first coffee cupping in the US.  Great way to try a variety of quality coffees and meet the people behind what makes Houndstooth unique.  You will never taste the same thing twice, as the coffee here changes, as it should.  It was nice to come out of the class learning a couple of things.  I liked their new sister label Tweed.  If you like a quality cup, and want to know more about what you are drinking, this is the place to come. See all photos from Mindy H. for Houndstooth Coffee ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 1/1/2016 This was the best coffee I had during my short visit to Austin. I had their more expensive expresso option, so maybe that is why. I really like the design of the place too. The only real drawback that I can think of is that it is inside a stale office building downtown. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/12/2015 1 check-in Dang! Hot damn! Wowza! This place is good. Very knowledgable staff. Interested in the learning the flavors you like before giving you just the pour of the day. This makes it a special experience, that it was brewed just for you. I'm a dirty chai kinda girl and they make one of the best in town. Nonetheless, they have lots of coffees to choose from. No matter your taste preference, they've got ya covered. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/20/2014 2 check-ins Nice coffee shop on Lamar next to Uchiko and now one downtown.  Pretty well made coffees with the perfect touch of crema on the espresso shots and baristas who know what they are doing.   They carry stuff from Counter culture and Madcap and it is always interesting to taste an espresso there and then rush over to other places (literally with all that caffeine..) and try it again there.    The nice thing is that they also offer a small variety of non-dairy alternatives for the vegetarians among us.  I particularly like the coffee with mint and a splash of selzer (I think that's their eponymous specialty) which is quite refreshing in the summer.  All in all, a pretty good place to swing by for caffeine or downers in form of beer and wine. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee , 10/24/2015 1 check-in Awesome location.  The wood counter tops are fab...as are the cups and the coffee!   Great people working here too.  I was impressed the girl who made my cappuccino knew most of the people in there by name! , pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/8/2015 While there are several locations, the location I tried was on the first floor of the Frost office building on Congress Ave, on a corner. It is small and sophisticated, and reminds me a lot of my favorite coffee shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan called Sweetwater Coffee. I don't drink coffee so I had the hot chocolate, which was made with real cocoa. When I complimented the wood bar, the barista told me that the bar, tables, and floor were all made from one pecan tree. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/19/2014 1 check-in Listed in Best Coffee Shops I have been at Houndstooth only twice but it is quickly becoming my go-to place when in downtown Austin.  The coffee shop is in the lobby of the iconic Frost tower, but is quite comfortable and not too corporate. There is even a nice outdoor sitting area.  The baristas are friendly and know what they are doing. The coffee is always exceptional. Their espresso machine is beautiful. This is clearly a shop run by people who know and love good coffee.  As always, I like to try a cortado or a macciato. It was so good that i had to ask for a second one. There are many good coffee shops in downtown Austin, Houndstooth is clearly one of the best.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/9/2015 Houndstooth is well lit, good coffee, and plays 90s and 2000s hip hop & rap classics by artists like DMX, Tupac, Nelly, etc.  Sound like your jam?  This came well recommended by a friend so went here twice during my short stint in ATX. They serve Counter Culture coffee, so it's as local as you can get.  Location is odd/tucked in, but this is 2015 and y'all have Google Maps, so I'm not worried about that.  My only hesitation here is no almond milk offerings, little snacks/pastries, and price ($4.60 for a latte). ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 6/10/2015 I went to have breakfast today but found out is a coffee shop. The coffee made up for not getting what I was looking for.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 11/1/2015 I love this place--it's not nearly as difficult to find a seat as at the original location on Lamar, but they need to get a Roomba or something--it's kind of gross how much dirt has accumulated in the corners. ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/17/2015 1 check-in I'm a huge coffee fan.  Austin has a bunch of coffee shops so you can imagine my excitement and list of coffee shops for this trip. My love for coffee is not always the coffee alone. I actually love going to coffee shops, especially ones with lots of uniqueness and characters to it. Ones that don't try to hard and have down to earth baristas that can teach you a thing or two about coffee, like this Houndstooth location.  Hidden behind a bookstore, Houndstooth is a very tiny shop. We couldn't locate it from the main street. We were greeted by the most awesome girl. She had blonde hair, a great style, and super friendly. She moved from Oakland to Austin a couple years ago (hi girl!).  She was very helpful and helped add to our list of things to see/do. The coffee itself was great. The aroma was wonderful and taste great.  I recommend grabbing your cup of joe from this shop if you are in the area! ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 8/10/2015 1 check-in First time ever coming here! It was a really nice place to catch up with some friends, and a very sophisticated looking location. I had the Japanese ice coffee which is a summer special and it was really good! The service was great, and the staff were very friendly and easy to make conversation with. I want to try hanging out at the Lamar location next time I get a chance, but this one is closer to the heart of downtown and UT! ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/12/2014 1 check-in Listed in Five Star Hotness, Austin, TX This is a very happy place for me.  I was working at a venue for SXSW across the street and the 18 hour work days were long. When there was anywhere between 5 -20 minutes of a break, you bet your bottom dollar I was here.  It's really quite simple if you ask me why!  Well, the clean lines of the coffee shop made my wannaknowmore about interior design heart skip a beat. The company around seemed to be all young professionals working comfortable on laptops or reading.  The coffee was full and rich - oh my gosh. There are plenty of options no matter what kind of coffee drinker you are.  Best part? The baristas. They were consistently kind - like genuinely kind and truly cared you got the right drink for you.  This is my new favorite coffee spot in Austin. What what! ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee , 3/5/2015 Delicious coffee in my honest opinion. The espresso really carries a smooth flavor. I paid $4.50 (plus $2 tip) for an 8 oz cortado...  ...That wasn't even made with Beyoncé's breast milk so $4.50 for 8 ounces of milk and espresso can't be justified. , neutral

Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/22/2014 1 check-in Listed in Caffeine Boost Huge fan of this Houndstooth location. The space is much larger, and the colors are warmer than its counterpart on N. Lamar, but you get the same, excellent coffee.  You can choose between the aeropress and the clever dripper as your method of choice, and you can still pick between two different beans. Gregory, the barista working at the time, was really friendly, and I also saw him patiently (and excitedly) explain the different coffee choices to others who came in. Kudos to you!  What I did love about this location is the atmosphere. It's very bright and open with plenty of seating. I came on a Saturday, which is typically less busy than the rest of the week since the usual business crowd aren't working.  There are only two cons to this location for me: 1) It's downtown, so you're gonna have to pay for parking. 2) They have keys for the bathrooms here - I hate it when coffee shops do this, it's like begging for germs to be spread since people don't always wash their hands. The baristas will touch these keys as well..I hope they get cleaned. This is me being a germaphobe.  As a stand alone shop, for sure one of the best in Austin. Prices are higher than other places in Austin, but you get quality. ", pos

Houndstooth Coffee ," 3/5/2014 1 check-in $3.90 is really pricy for green tea, but I do have to admit that this place excels in being trendy and comfortable. Their tea is also served in a minipot, so it is larger than your typical Starbucks serving. Gunpowder green tea ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 5/23/2014 Some of the friendliest baristas you'll find around here! Espresso is fantastic and they offer two different single origin coffees at a time. I got a cortado with their Tweed beans (Colombia) and the chocolatey notes became more distinct the longer I drank it. They sell Askinosie chocolate, a small bean-to-bar single origin chocolate, which is great for pairing. The coffee shop offers indoor and outdoor seating and readily accessible.  Also the bathroom keys use frothing pitchers for key chains which is pretty hilarious. Cappuccino and cortado ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 2/19/2014 1 check-in First of all, the barista is not the most friendly person in the world. I would even go as far as to say she was downright rude.  If you've never been there before it's extremely confusing and even if you're standing right in front of her she wont acknowledge you until you just tell her what you want. As you can imagine, if you dont even KNOW what you want this can be frustrating. She didn't even look up at us when we quite obviously walked up to the counter right in front of her. The weird part about it is there wasnt a menu even posted so when I walked up to her I actually needed help. She didnt say one word and I just looked around until I found something that looked like a menu. That is definitely not how I want to start any day. Obviously, I havent HAD coffee yet (since I'm there to receive my java fix), please dont piss me off this early...  The coffee was good which gives this place one star and the atmosphere was nice which gives me the other 2 stars. They need to work on, I dunno, smiling for starters and maybe basic communication can be next on the list. Customer service would give this place a firm 4 star rating and having a menu to make this whole proc ess quick and smooth would land this place a 5 star easily but...they definitely did not do that this time.  I may give this place one more shot, or just stick to Jo's off of SoCo since they're awesome all the time and know how to say ""hi"" when customers walk up. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/13/2013 1 check-in Wanted to check out some of Austin's finest in regards to coffee and houndstooth came up on quite a few lists.  The space was nice and there was an outdoor front area we enjoyed thoroughly. On Sunday around noon there were plenty of seats and no wait. The coffee was good and what you'd expect from a business serious about coffee, but nothing to blow me away and warrant a return trip.  We ordered a morning bun, Mexican chocolate donut, and a couple of lattes. The barista wasn't that helpful in helping me to figure out what to order, but it seemed like he tried by asking if I had any questions and describing some of their selection.  The place, service, and cost, is good, not great. It was pricey and I walked away regretting the extra 15% tip. I wouldn't return, because I just wasn't that impressed. What I liked most was the space.  Coffee: good; pastries: good; space: good; service: ok. Overall: good.  I'm hoping others walk away with a better impression. ", neutral 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 9/5/2013 1 check-in Listed in Yelp 100 Challenge in 365 days I actually came to Houndstooth after the Hot Lava Obstacle Course event. I was curious about being a coffee geek. The event was called Coffee Geekery and I had to go. All I know about coffee was Folgers was crap and I bought anything was not Folgers or the cheap coffee for that matter. Yes I was aware there different types of coffee from different countries. But I didn't realize there was more to coffee than expected such as the aftertaste, the feeling, the balance, etc. Coffee sampling or cuppery is maybe what wine tasting is about.

Houndstooth Coffee ," 7/3/2014 2 check-ins First things first, I've been here for coffee nearly everyday I've worked in Austin. I love the environment, the location and the workers here. Coffee variety is pretty interesting, they have many unique drinks a place like Starbucks would lack.  My one complaint is that with so many unique drinks they also fall kinda short on some typical coffee flavored like hazelnut. On top of that, some of the specialty drinks can be a little pricier...  But it is at the base of the frost bank tower, one of the nicest buildings in Austin and near a lot of financial corporate organizations. My point is, people are willing to spend a little more money.  Overall I'd recommend this place. It's pretty great just not perfect for me Very nice setting right outside of houndstooth to sit and enjoy a coffee with a friend ", pos 
Houndstooth Coffee ," 10/12/2014 To me, this Houndstooth location sums up Austin perfectly. Having lived in and around Dallas/Fort Worth for the past five years, I had just started taking it as a given that a bank tower's ground floor coffee shop is a Starbucks. It's so refreshing to finally see an amazing local coffee shop in a great location.  Having only been to this location once and on a Friday, I don't know if my experience was typical. Given my experience with their location on Lamar, I have a feeling that this one stays really busy all day. If you want your pick of Tacodeli breakfast taco, get here early. When I was here just after 8, they had already sold out of most of them.  I tried the Japanese Iced Coffee which was the first time I have seen this type of iced coffee on a menu here in Texas. Houndstooth knocked it out of the park. I'm not a huge iced/cold brew coffee fan, but when it's 90+ outside, this will definitely be added to my coffee rotation. ", pos

Flat Track Coffee ," 4/19/2016 1 check-in Stopped in here on a whim because I'm always down for a cup of coffee.  This store sells bikes and coffee.  It looks like they were currently going through some remodeling or construction so it was a bit loud inside with the work going on.  I decided to try the Mexican Mocha which is always one of my favorite coffees and they did a great job with it.  There is parking in front of the store.  Hopefully when the remodeling and construction is done there will be seats inside and somewhere to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee and possibly check out the bikes.  Right now there is a lot of dust so it is more of a grab and go.  If you are feeling like a cup of coffee after some La BBQ, DeeDee, Bufalina, etc, I would definitely recommend you give these guys a shot or better yet let them sell you a shot or 2 of espresso. window sign coffee bar Street sign ", pos
